I could go on and on and on.  The PCP is beautiful and reasonably priced which allows us to visit more frequently.  If you have any questions, please message me.

We\u2019ve stayed at many all-inclusive resorts all over Mexica and Cuba so have extensive experience to compare.", "We had an amazing first time experience at the Punta Cana Princess All Suites and would definitely return.  This beautiful beach is never-ending in both directions for walking/jogging, the water is warm and very swimmable with enough waves to make it interesting.  We found all resort employees to be most pleasant, personable and helpful! The energetic and enthusiastic entertainment team was a riot and so talented-they worked from late morning to late at night in the lobby. Various recreational activities are scheduled throughout the day (outdoor ping-pong, bocce, horse-shoes, archery, volleyball, stretching\u2026) for those who wish to participate.  The variety of food options was excellent and we ate everywhere. The liquor choices and wine were plentiful and enjoyable.  We were provided with a bottle of D.R. champagne, at dinner, for my husband\u2019s birthday!  It was like a white wine spritzer- really smooth!  Punta Cana Princess All Suites offers the intimacy of a small resort as well as the opportunity to expand into the two Caribe Club Princess and Tropical Princess next door (within walking distance via the beach, road or being driven). Loved free wifi in the lobby.  Good opportunity for us all to check in with family/friends but to spend most time off line!  WhatsApp worked well to communicate and to send the odd picture; texting /email, not so well. Email worked fine without attachments.  We found this resort to be meticulously clean (including all public washrooms) and well-groomed outside.", "Pick-up at airport went smoothly.  Since there are many hotels with Princess in the name, be sure to clearly state Punta Cana Princess All Suites. One couple got on the wrong bus. The drive to the hotel was about an hour with all the previous hotel drop offs.", "Check-in was pleasant, friendly, with a nice cool drink while waiting in line.  We were first assigned a room with a garden/pool view-we politely indicated we had paid for an ocean-view and were immediately reassigned a room in building 5 (top floor-room 5205). We were given a map of the resort and 2 neighbouring sister resorts and were told to walk to the room and our luggage would be delivered shortly-it was.  ", "Our room-very clean, fresh smelling, well maintained. Comfortable king bed-we asked for an extra pillow the next morning and reported the hand-held shower-hose detached from the head during my shower-all in place/repaired before we returned from the beach-excellent service!  Two large water bottles a day plus one in the mini fridge provided daily.  Some bottles were almost impossible to open and others opened easily.  I found if I put the bottle on a low surface, used a wet facecloth to grip and pushed down while trying to unscrew it, it sometimes helped.  My husband had to use a pocket-knife to cut a few caps off.  We were told to use the bottled water even for brushing teeth. Toiletries provided-their milk moisturizer was nice, we brought our own intensive hair-conditioner. Room safe, iron and ironing board provided.  We request the top floor wherever we stay for the view and exercise up/down the stairs (no elevators) so request a lower floor if your party has mobility challenges). Air-conditioning was adjustable and worked well.  Liked the fan above the bed. Our room was pretty much sound-proof.  ", "Bathroom-spacious, open concept-the toilet stall does have a door to provide some privacy.  The large shower has a hand-held and an overhead rain shower head with great water pressure and always hot water available. The shower has a little alcove with a shelf which was convenient to store items.  There is a hook across from the sink to hang a small bag to store personal toiletries-not a lot of storage near the sink (no shelves,drawers). Hairdryer provided.", "We refused to play the \u201creserve a chair\u201d game and we always were able to find loungers under a palapa  at the beach, maybe not in the first 2 rows, but always in the 3rd.  We used the single and double kayak 3X when the water was calm enough-most days we felt it was too rough to kayak.  We swam at the pool only if the beach was too windy. Our balcony faced the beach end of the pool so we were entertained with the end of the day pool antics (lol) when we returned from the beach.", "Food: Breakfast and lunch-mostly ate at the Mare Nostrum (smaller and close to the oceanview) where we found there was more than enough delicious food options for us.  Omelets are available-if the cook is prepping in the back just call out, \u201cHola\u201d and he\u2019ll come right out with a smile and create an omelet of your choice. Mare Nostrum was our favorite restaurant to eat dinner-the paella for two and seafood dinner were amazing.  Try the seafood casserole appetizer-such a flavourful broth!  We had fine experiences and meals at all the other restaurants on site as well.  Love how you can just show up-no reservations!  We did make reservations to eat at the sister resort two times.  We enjoyed The Dominican Restaurant-La Cava and the Brazillian Rodizio.", "Tours: Booked all three with Nexus/Sunwing in the lobby. We booked one trip in Canada before we left and found if we had booked it on the plane we would have saved $11.00 each.  When booking at the resort expect to be charged US rates.  Santo Domingo Tour (13 hours, lots of info in 3 languages, interesting sites), Country Express Tour-visited a house, coffee/cacao plantation-with an amazing shop-well priced vanilla, chocolate bars, coffee and chocolate tea, visited a school, had a very tasty traditional DR lunch then visited a beautiful public beach-strong wave action-although many people went into the water the waves were high/strong and we witnessed one local in distress-got sucked out and needed help to get back. Alex the tour guide was one of the best we\u2019ve had.  Saona Island Tour (we sailed a catamaran out and were power-boated back-try to sit near the back of the boat to avoid pounding and getting soaked).  Little if any shade on the catamaran and expect to dance on the boat-no isn\u2019t readily accepted. Our tour was a full bus-load.  It would be interesting to try a smaller group tour BUT we liked being power boated back since it was a few hour catamaran trip out. Saona Island was pumped full of tourist boats/tourists and the massage vendors were relentless.  When you\u2019re sitting on the loungers and you don\u2019t want a massage, be clear/firm as some tried putting their hands on our shoulders to start massaging, even when we said no thank you. If you do get a massage confirm the price before starting. We overheard a massage lady hassle the person for not paying her enough.  ", "Pack-a small flashlight or two for night walking (walkways are lit but we prefer direct lighting), especially when walking from the two sister resorts, extra sunscreen, aftersun lotion, small make-up mirror (mandatory)-low lighting in bathroom, extra strength bug-spray (I didn\u2019t get bitten until our last 4 nights but got many from then on and our bug spray wasn\u2019t effective), Imodium, Pepto Bismol or similar products just in case (my husband did get an upset stomach for about 12 hours,)-resort store with such items is expensive. ", "Tipping: We converted Canadian into American and Dominican before we left.  I think American only would be easier.  We tipped our maid $2.00 daily, then other workers randomly but pretty consistently.  It is NOT necessary to tip everyone all the time.  You get a smile and service with or without tipping.   ", "Random Kudos-staff, location and upkeep of resort, seafood and fresh fruit, beach towels are aplenty and maid placed new ones nightly in our room, lots of shade (palapas) at the beach, ocean wonderful to swim in.  Quality and variety of entertainment at night in the lobby, bar area at Mare Nostrum or at the Serenata Theatre at the sister resort. I emailed the resort before we left indicating the purpose of our trip was to celebrate my husband\u2019s retirement and his birthday date.  Our room was decorated with some balloon flowers on his birthday which was appreciated.  Recycling-thick plastic glasses are washed and reused, no straws. Good job.  Our flight was delayed 4 hours but we were able to have full use of the resort until we left at 6:00 p.m.  I was able to have a wonderful impromptu pedicure at the spa (fairly close to the lobby) during the delay-very thorough and enjoyable pedi!  ", "Random Gripes-wish the gym was better equipped, non-stop vendors walking up and down beach selling their wares.  Although having a picture taken with a parrot, iguana or monkey might turn your crank, I felt sorry for the creatures being carried around all day, outside in the hot sun.  Not much of a life for these animals and obliging tourists perpetuate this practice.  The lobby offers wonderful and varied entertainment in the the evening using the area near the entry/exit few stairs to the resort-reminder it\u2019s polite to wait until the song/act is completed before entering/leaving.  Some people were walking almost through the aerobatic circus performers while they were in action, so dangerous and rude. We wish-smokers would be responsible for their butts.  Leaving them in the sand is disgusting. ", "We\u2019d highly recommend staying at Punta Cana Princess All Suites to experience a most wonderful holiday get away.  The resort was mostly quiet shortly after 11, which we appreciated after attending the varied and quality entertainment suited to young adults and old. This resort offers a perfect setting and well run/maintained resort (well-treated and happy employees). Our experience at this resort was close to perfection."]},

{"hotel": ["Secrets Royal Beach Punta Cana"], "title": ["Excelente!"], "content": ["We had a great experience from landing at the airport to our departure. We utilized AmStar for transport and highly recommend it. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a glass of champagne and taken by golf cart to our swim-up, pool view room. Everyone was seeking ways to make the experience special. We were especially impressed with Yuluy at the Portofino restaurant and JP in the preferred lounge. Both went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and paid incredible attention to detail. We also enjoyed the humor of Willy Wonka at the Rosewater Bar by the preferred pool. The only lapse in service we felt while there for 3 nights was with our assigned butler, Michael. We never had a fully functioning tablet in our suite, and he missed a text that disallowed my husband from getting a tee time for golf. But he did make sure we had the rum my husband liked and did a flower petal design for us the last night. Portofino was our favorite restaurant, and we would recommend avoiding Oceana. The Market Cafe was good for variety both at breakfast and lunch, and we liked the skewers at the Barefoot Grill. The only other question mark we had was about tipping. It was a maze to figure out how much, when, etc. Like are you supposed to tip the person who helps you with placing towels on chairs on the beach?  If so, how much?  Why not allow people to add gratuity for excellent service to the room bill at the end to simplify things?  Lastly, we enjoyed the spa and our couples\u2019 massage. The only thing we would have liked to do possibly is enjoy it on the beach, as we saw the facility to do so but never utilized. Overall, a wonderful experience, and we would stay here again. Definitely recommend. "]},

{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Beautiful resort and amazing staff"], "content": ["Just returned from a 7 day girls trip at Punta Cana Princess.  The resort is beautiful and the rooms very nice.  Had a small problem with water flooding the bathroom while you had a shower but it was corrected if you didn't have the shower on full blast, which was fine as it is a soaker shower with good water flow.  There is very poor lighting in the bathroom and hallway, where the only mirrors are in the room.  This made it difficult to apply makeup while getting ready for dinner, and you pretty much had to do it by feel and hope you looked okay when you got out into the light.  The Tex Mex and Italian Restaurants were very good as was the Buffet that had a different theme every night.  The Fondue Restaurant was 'different', and luckily we were able to head to the buffet afterwards.  I travel 4-5 times a year in the Carribean and  I have to say that the staff at this resort were amazing.  Everyone was helpful, polite, and they really seemed to enjoy their jobs.  They truly appreciated any tips and it was unfortunate to see so many people not tipping the staff.  The beach is beautiful and the pool was nice as well, although you needed the ocean breeze in the afternoon.  We stayed in building 4 which was close to everything, although the resort is very small so everything is close.  There is very little nightly entertainment at the resort and we were told we could take a shuttle over to the disco, which opens at 11pm.  We waited 90 minutes and when the shuttle still didn't arrive we called it a night.  There is a little outdoor strip of shops along the beach not far from the resort and you can buy souvenirs, hats, jewelry and artwork.  Be warned, the vendors are very aggressive and something that starts out as $75.00 U.S.usually ends up selling for $10.00.   The ocean was very rough for swimming but there was almost no seagrass which was nice.  All in all this is a very nice resort, my biggest complaint was that I could not enjoy a glass of wine with my meals at dinner.  They have one brand of wine in red, white or rose.  I tried them all and am usually very easy to please however the wines were undrinkable.  The red wine is probably a 4 in the sweetness scale.  On one of the nights I actually caved and bought a $16.00 bottle of wine so that I could enjoy my steak dinner.  Other than that I would most certainly return to this resort.  A shoutout to Emilio at the lobby bar, who always had a smile and always made us smile.  Also a mention to the front desk staff and the concierges Carmen, Miguel and Favier."]},

Tons of nice pools and great food, awesome beach. The Argentinan restaurant is amazing! The Japanese is also very good along with the multiple buffets all over.  My biggest complaint is the room. We booked the bavaro side and were placed in the Punta Cana section. We didn\u2019t question it because we believed the resort/rooms were similar. The bed was one of the hardest matresses I\u2019ve ever slept on. Another issue was the air conditioning. It went on for 30 seconds at a time at night and remained off for about 80-85% of the night. I know this because I was up for at least two nights past 3 am because the room was so warm. There was a fan above the bed which we used the first night but after that it made the loudest noises and kept us up as well. We had to turn the fan off as well. I called two different days about the air after I let the lobby know in person and they told me would come . They did come because I received the phone call explaining they had came and said it works fine. Hopeful it would finally work like a normal air conditioner, it did not at all that night. Another extremely warm night. All in all, we are not one to complain. As much as I loved the food here and the Bars open late, along with the great atmosphere of the resort, I don\u2019t think I could return based on how horrible we slept the 6 nights we were here. Another main concern is the amount of vendors harassing you to buy things all over the resort as well as the beach 24/7. I\u2019d say 3.5 stars out of 5."]},

Lancelot and his colleague were particularly great with my kids when they were playing in the pool, making a big fuss of them and letting them enjoy the paddle boards.  We had 2 adjoining rooms with Oscar Moya as our concierge. Our rooms were great loads of space and always kept beautifully clean.  Oscar was great at looking after our everyday needs/reservations but he went above and beyond anything I could have asked for when our son got unexpectedly sick.

We have been to Punta Cana now 4 times and this would be the only resort we would return to if we came back.", "Check-in was easy and we were taken to our room immediately.  We had a ground floor room near the pool. The room was exactly as advertised - the greatest thing was the room was spotless, most comfortable king bed ever had at a resort, AC worked great, no musty room smell, toilet didn't leak, shower head was awesome and we never ran out of hot water like other resorts.  The walls are solid concrete so we never heard noise from adjacent rooms which was a bonus. The complimentary bottle of rum in the room was a nice touch upon arrival along with other things provided in the room such as an umbrella, slippers and housecoat. Only complaint about the room was the small toilet area as mentioned in other reviews (would have done away with the jacuzzi tub which nobody uses and made toilet area larger). Our patio view wasn't terrific - dead grass, no privacy bushes and the area was littered with cigarette butts and coke bottles which should be cleaned up. The housekeeping staff were good, but they never locked our patio door after cleaning and we know we locked it before leaving the room each day.  I would recommend bringing a rubber bottle opener to open the water bottles left daily - we had a very difficult time opening all the water bottles and if it wasn't for my husband I would never have been able to open any.", "While people put their towels out early, we always managed to find a seat around the pool each day.  The pool was a nice size, although a little cool for my liking but once in it was refreshing.", "We visited the Italian restaurant 2x and would highly recommend the lasagna and tomato basil soup.  The Fondue restaurant was okay - the shrimp appetizer was awesome.  The Steak house was just ok - I didn't like my grouper due to the texture but then again I am picky with fish. My husband had the steak which came with a gravy which is unusual.  The buffets were okay.  We frequented the beach bar restaurant especially later at night - it was great if you wanted a drink after the entertainment was over and if you got hungry in the wee hours they had great burgers, fries, pizza and fried chicken.  This restaurant also had a great view of the ocean and comfy lounge chairs.  One thing we missed at this resort however was a gourmet coffee shop which serves Spanish/Irish coffees as seen in other resorts.", "Although other resorts have a formal theatre for shows at night which we have always found corny, we loved the Punta Cana Princess idea - have the entertainment in the front lobby - it felt close and personal and they tried to get everyone involved.  We loved the circus act particularly and the Michael Jackson disco night.

My husband participated in archery and the horseshoe toss which he enjoyed.", "Although the bars tried to pass off the low end alcohol, a tip and request for a higher end liquor solved that problem easily.  The red wine was passable which was a nice surprise as most resorts I haven't been able to drink it.", "Overall we thought all the staff were friendly and helpful.

You keep asking the staff but not forthcoming.  This also applied to the lunchtime and evening re beers and wine.  There is not enough staff to cover everything, re-setting tables seems to be of the most urgent.  Used the other restaurants, all seem as though they want you served and out as quick as they can.

{"hotel": ["Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Horrible!"], "content": ["We stayed at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort & Spa for 5 nights with another couple, celebrating my 30th birthday & an impending proposal. We booked directly on their website which promised $1250 in resort credits, a fruit basket, bottle of alcohol, free transfer, etc. They have almost 5 star reviews, with such few poor ratings, we thought \u201chow could we go wrong?\u201d... I guess that was a challenge. I know this is very long, but I wanted to take the time to write this in hopes to help at least one person that is deciding to stay here not make the mistake that we did by choosing this resort. This is not my first time visiting Punta Cana and we all are in the hospitality industry \u2014 so we knew, for the most part, what we should & shouldn\u2019t expect from our trip. I truly wish we listened to the negative reviews because they were horrifyingly true, down to almost every single detail. ", "Check in \u2014 we got to the hotel \u202aaround 2:15PM\u202c, checked in with a very nice receptionist & were advised that we could get our room at 3 when check in started. They brought us a non-alcoholic welcome drink and it was great. We followed up \u202aat 3PM\u202c as advised and they said they needed more time and said to come back in 20 minutes. We started to get frustrated but agreed and went back to the bar. 20 minutes goes by and we check again, the room still isn\u2019t ready. Now we\u2019re aggravated because they took our luggage and we explained that we wanted to shower and change so we could go and eat. We came from the USA and from a much colder climate, so we were in more clothing than we would have liked for the heat & humidity. It took \u202auntil 3:50\u202c to get a room but finally got one so we were excited to get the vacation started. Little did we know, a few days in we found out the lobby had showers and changing rooms for you to use before/after check out. Not sure why no one told us, as this would have made the wait a lot better and less aggravating. This was only the beginning. ", "Hotel room \u2014 There were flowers all over the room and a sign on the door for my birthday. The bottle of alcohol was in the room (a small bottle of rum) as well as the fruit basket, which was cut & whole fruit & should have been refrigerated, so we didn\u2019t eat it. The room had a balcony & a big, round jetted tub. I walk around the room to check it out and I start to notice how dirty it was. The bed had many stains on it, as well as a TON of hair all on the top of the bed spread. The hair seemed to be a common theme, as it was found in the sink, shower & on the toilet. The safe didn\u2019t work either, so our stuff was left out for hours (no, it was not feasible to carry around cash, passports, iPads, etc). I took pictures and began to Clorox the room so we could shower and go get food. After feeling disgusted from the shower & the handle that was sorta hanging from the wall & was dirty (and easily wiped off), I called down to the front desk. The phone barely had buttons so I had no idea how to reach them. I opted for just dialing 0, and was greeted in Spanish, transferred 3 times and finally got someone. I told them the room was dirty and asked if someone could come up. They said they would send them up, so we waited, for an hour. I called again half way through waiting and they said someone was on the way. Nope, no one came. So we went to the front desk and they said someone would be up to clean it. We gave up & went on our way to explore. A few hours later, no one came. So we got ourselves together the best we could and went out for dinner. On the way back we went to guest services instead and I expressed my frustrations. They came to the room with me to check it out, took some pictures & equally seemed horrified that they put us in that room. For waiting 1-1/2 hours for a room, you\u2019d think it would have been immaculately cleaned. After a few calls, they asked us to wait in reception for a new room. They asked if our bags were packed about 30 minutes later (no, why would they be, no one asked us to do that), so we had to go back to the room & call when we were done. Took another 15 minutes or so for someone to come back. We finally made it to a new room while our friends waited for us for hours. The room was cleaner, but the refrigerator didn\u2019t work, our toilet ran almost constantly, we lost our welcome gifts & the AC was way too hot and you couldn\u2019t put it below 72\u00b0F. When it\u2019s 10\u00b0 warmer outside, that 10\u00b0 difference doesn\u2019t really help. We told them for 3 days that the AC and fridge weren\u2019t working and it was never fixed. We gave up from there. Outside of these problems, our sheets were never changed in the 5 nights there and there is no fitted sheet on the bed, just a single top sheet, that came undone so easily and you found yourself on the bare mattress mid sleeping (gross!). House keeping comes 8-5, and if you don\u2019t have a do not disturb sign (like we didn\u2019t) ask for one, cause they try to barge into your room constantly. Thank god for the chain lock. In addition, the mini bar was filled with only 2 bottles of water, that a few times, were opened already! I even opened the door for the guy who filled it and noticed it was opened already when he handed it to me. For a place that specifically says on their website to ONLY drink bottled water, the lack of water in the room (that you don\u2019t have to pay an additional $2/bottle for more) doesn\u2019t help, because the only place in the resort with bottled water is the front desk. Lastly, towels, 99% of the time they smelled like fish, and you couldn\u2019t grab another towel because they only gave you two (even though our first room started with 4). ", "Travel Club \u2014 It\u2019s crazy how this one effected us so much. The travel club agent, Victor Pena, came over when we checked in. I wish we had been firmer up front when we said we weren\u2019t interested because this was the first of many encounters from him. They claim they\u2019re not a time share, but it\u2019s the Grand Palladium Hotels membership and we didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. They\u2019ll promise you a free breakfast, reservations, massages, etc and harass you the ENTIRE trip. We had to avoid certain walk ways and take extra time to get places so they wouldn\u2019t talk to us. We were harassed by them more than the excursion people on the beach.. which is insane. You can tell the guys on the beach no, firm but politely, and they go away with a smile on their face. You say no or \u201cI\u2019m not interested\u201d to the travel club and they walk with you until you have to be rude to make them stop. No one should be following you around on vacation to sign up for a membership that you don\u2019t want. We told them how there were things to be fixed in our room and they said they would get it done, in exchange for going to the meeting. It never got done... only got the same fruit basket and bottle of liquor that were missing from the new room. ", "Bars \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of them, but the liquor choices were scarce. The beer was only presidente and sometimes Budweiser. In addition, some of the liquor appeared to be watered down. Yes, this is a bold accusation. Two of us are bartenders of 10+ years and know what most liquor should taste like. We tested a brand new bottle & one that has been open (at different bars) as a shot and we\u2019re surprised at the difference.  We were wondering why 5+ drinks in we didn\u2019t feel a thing. Want to try champagne to get a quicker buzz? Don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s only 5% alcohol & tastes like water. I found that out a few days in. Unfortunately on the last night we found Hemingways bar and that had a lot more alcohol and much better drinks. Very disappointing... ", "Food \u2014 There is a lot I have to say on the food. I\u2019ll start off with the worst. All 4 of us got food poisoning. Mild for the first few days, moderate/severe for the last few. The buffet food was not kept cold/hot as it should have been. It didn\u2019t matter if you were one of the first people there or the last. It was never held at correct temperature (sternos were out/ice melted & not replenished) for the amount of time that it was out. There were never enough utensils for the buffet. The signs rarely were in the correct spot or there just wasn\u2019t a sign for some. I asked at one point for some tongs for a fajita station and she took RAW CHICKEN TONGS (raw chicken that was just sitting in the heat, on a platter) and grabbed ready to eat food, put it in a burrito, gave a quick heating to the outside and served it. If this is what I saw out in the open, what was happening behind the scenes? Is this why we were getting sick? Unfortunately, these problems happened at all the buffets we went to, and some a la carte restaurants. For al la carte restaurants, the wait was always 20+ min, and that\u2019s if you got there early. If you came after \u202a7:30\u202c/8, it was at least 45+ min. These restaurants were only open 6-10. The wait for food & drinks were extremely long and typically did not come out right. The only place we had great food & service was the hibachi restaurant. When they tell you that reservations fill up by \u202a7:30AM\u202c for the next day, they\u2019re not kidding. We happened to wake up early one day and went down to make a reservation. \u202aAt 7:25AM\u202c they were all taken up except \u202a5:45PM\u202c and \u202a10PM\u202c. It\u2019s worth being up super early for and the best meal we had (maybe because it was the freshest?). There were also beach BBQs & a snack hut, which were nice, but a lot of the food was under cooked and you had to ask them for well done for it to be cooked properly (like the chicken). The sports bar was open 24 hours, with a buffet for food, as well as a menu. If you tried to order something off the menu that was at the buffet, they made you get it there, so try and order something you didn\u2019t see. That food wasn\u2019t replenished often and barely kept to proper temperature. ", "Entertainment \u2014 the disco had great music & good drinks. Everyone was there to dance and have a great time. It was a really great vibe if you can make it when they open \u202aat 11:15PM\u202c. The Bavaro hotel lobby seemed to be where all the fun was too. The music was loud and there was always people there. The Punta Cana lobby had great singers nightly, but the vibe otherwise was lacking. ", "Pools/Beach \u2014 there are many fresh water pools scattered around with varying hours. Though, they\u2019re always filled with kids splashing and infants that didn\u2019t have diapers on, which there didn\u2019t seem like there was any rules against that. There is an all adult pool, but the vibe there is quiet, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. The pools had music but it was so low, it didn\u2019t really help the atmosphere. Though Stanley, at the Saona pool, was by far our favorite bartender and staff member this resort has employed. He was always greeting us from across the pool, making jokes and drinks were made without having to ask or wait. He really is the reason for this trip getting one star. If you decide to stay here, you must go see him! He didn\u2019t try and solicit tips like the rest of the staff (but was very deserving of any) and he always made you feel welcome and like \u201cfamily\u201d, as most would call you. ", "Staff \u2014 some were nice, some were not. You were made to feel like an inconvenience most of the time and like they were expecting a tip from you for anything you asked for. We tipped, a lot, because that\u2019s the industry we are in and barely seemed appreciated when we did. There was a language barrier for sure, but when we did use Spanish (and used it correctly) they would answer you in English and make you feel ignorant for trying to speak their native language. That was pretty uncomfortable. ", "Resort credits \u2014 I wish someone explained what these were before I booked direct. It was the only reason I spent an additional $200 & lost out on thousands of JetBlue points, because I assumed it was an actual credit of some sort, not a book of coupons for specific things only. The coupons were awful in my opinion. Didn\u2019t end up using any of them because they just weren\u2019t a good value, or the terms & conditions made them not usable. Who wants a $15 credit to a store... me! Wait, just kidding, it\u2019s only for Oakley or other expensive things in there that you probably didn\u2019t even need to buy. ", "Stores \u2014 few and far between, very expensive ($6 for a bag of chips, $3 candy bars, $5 beers/Gatorade, etc). Souvenirs for the most part were fairly priced. There is also a $15 minimum on credit cards and it\u2019s in USD for cash transactions. ", "Casino \u2014 small, never busy (which can be good) & you played in USD. There were only \u201cluck\u201d games there.. roulette, black jack & slots. If there was Texas Holdem, 3 card poker, etc that would have gotten us to stay in there a lot longer and spend a lot more money. ", "Spa \u2014 we went to the spa and explained that we had resort credits and wanted to check pricing. They gave us a great deal on a massage, facial & scrub ($250 for two) but opted just for a massage, which was $140 including tip for two, as well as use of the day spa. We didn\u2019t use the resort credits, as this was a better deal. They evened accommodated us right then & there. This was by far the best experience we had at the resort. The food was fresher, colder & a different variety than the other buffets. I wish we could have spent all day here. ", "All & all, I do not suggest staying here. The few pros do not outweigh the cons. There are many other places to stay that are better. I told the staff during the vacation about our problems and even at the end when they tried soliciting a \u201c10\u201d or 5 star review for the stay. They didn\u2019t care what I had to say at all. I\u2019ve emailed and done the survey and almost two weeks later, still no response to rectify what we encountered during our trip. Please do your research and don\u2019t waste the thousands of dollars like we did. Happy traveling!"]},

All of them (bar staff, restaurant staff, entertainment team, maids, gardeners, front desk, everyone ) are very hard working but always smiling and ready with an \"Hola\" and really go out of their way to make your holiday great.  Our towel rack came away from the wall, I went to lobby to report it and it was fixed before I made it back to the our room an hour later.  The bar staff remembered our drinks orders and always happy to serve us.  As many others have mentioned, the staff really made our 2 weeks terrific.", "The resort is quiet and relaxing with wonderfully maintained grounds, a nice pool and right on a lovely beach where you can walk for a long way in either direction.  There are vendors but a simple no thank you (or better yet, no gracias) works.  We walked the beach for 2-3 hours per day and honestly by the third day, they recognized us and did not even ask anymore.  The ocean was rough on most days, lots of waves and the staff did an excellent job of cleaning up the seaweed if any showed up overnight.  ", "Wonderful views from the beach bar and the beach BBQ that was held a few times a week was a treat, excellent ribs and other grilled food and refreshing sangria all served on the beach.", "The resort is super clean, even the beach bathroom which can be hard to maintain was always clean.  The rooms were very clean as well.  No musty smell in the room as we have seen in other resorts and the AC worked well....so well we had to turn off some nights as it was too cool for us.", "Entertainment team had many activities planned during the morning, and later in the afternoon.  No pressure to join but fun if you wanted to.  Most nights, we had a show or contest in the lobby bar or you could visit the Caribe Resort next door to see their show.  We tried this one night, fun but we liked our resort so much better, less crowded, hectic and of course no kids...which is the main reason we chose an adult only resort.", "We visited the gym almost every day, it was not huge but had all the equipment needed for a good workout, if you wanted to do one.  Also, the pathways around the PCP and Caribe made great running trails if you did not want to run on the sand.", "Cons:", "The only small issue we had was with trying to visit the a la carte restaurants.  I loved the idea on not having to make reservations but when we tried to go in one of our first nights, we were denied entry because although my husband had long trousers and a short sleeved dress shirt, he wore nice leather sandals.  Now, I checked the dress code on the Princess website while packing and again the day before we left and there is no mention of closed toe shoes but this was required for entry. So, it was the buffet for us for 2 weeks. I did notice however, over the course of 2 weeks, plenty of men in casual shorts/sweatpants and running shoes eating at the a la cartes, so the dress code enforcement is inconsistent.", "Management suggestion: I would recommend updating your website if closed shoes are required so that we can pack what is needed and being consistent in your enforcement of the dress code.", "Having said that, it was not really an issue for us, the food at the buffet was good and each night had a different theme.  The Valentine Day buffet that was put on extra special, and every night we had lots of choice of different items so very easy to have a nice meal, not a five star gourmet meal but still good.", "However, I would advise against the Asian night.  Both of us have good stomachs and never suffer any issues in our many years of travel but the first week I got sick after Asian night and the second week my husband did.   Nothing major, better the next day but we never figured out what food caused the problem. ", "The guests here like at many other resorts we have been to are doing the towel dance with both pool and beach chairs being saved starting as early as 7am.  My husband and I like to walk the beach and the resort and are not much for sitting on our butts all day but we had no problem finding chairs any time we wanted to relax by the pool or beach for a hour so not really a problem.", "Overall, we had a great time and would return to Punta Cana Princess and would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet, laid back, relaxing holiday."]},

The staff that work here are just like family.  Always singing, dancing and soon learn what your likes and dislikes are.  In the buffet Raysa always greets her guests with a huge hug and of course always teasing involved.  Two of our main servers Carlos and Danielle were always on top of things and they to were always teasing and laughing with the guests.  The food was wonderful, we have experienced in the past that after two weeks you often get tired of the buffet, but not in this resort.  We always looked forward to our meals.  Our drink orders were always awaiting us without asking.  Cappacino with desert didn't even have to ask it was always brought to the table.  Don't know how they remember all of this with so many people on the resort.  Rooms were spotless and the night service and turn down was something a person could soon get used to.  No need to go find new beach towels for the day as they always collected them and gave new ones in the evening.  The beach was wonderful, although we did have windy days.  The water was always warm and not to rough.  They had a man on the beach who would always go find you whatever you needed.  Extra chair no problem he was soon back with one.  The only issue we did have was the bugs or whatever they were.  Nasty little buggers that soon left welts on your legs, so make sure you take insect repellent, especially for the evening.  Would definately recommend something stronger than off and make sure you take something for the itch otherwise this will drive you crazy.  Definately are not the same as the mosquitoes in Canada. But with a little prep they will not be an issue.  There was not one staff member on this resort who was not happy and willing to help you out with whatever you need.  Went on a half day excursion out into the Dominican country side, Nilo was our guide and he was wonderful.  It was well worth the money spent and sure make one realize just how fortunate we are.  Remember the Domincan is not just about how nice the resort is, you really need to go see what this place is really all about.  Happy travels and hope you will give this place a try.  One more thing I should mention each building has three floors so if you have any problems with stairs make sure to get the lower level because there are no elevators."]},

The entire experience was subpar, creepy, and not worth my money.

Also, the room was not to a cleanliness standard I would expect from a resort.

While I was photographing the scenery, one CREEPY security guard in particular was very aggressive with the way he approached me and spoke to me. It honestly scared me. I showed him my wrist band that I had in my bag. He then scolded me on why he has a right to be aggressive with me because I was not wearing it. The VERY NEXT morning I was photographing more scenery as soon as I woke up. I did forget my wrist band and he sought me out again and asked for my wrist band aggressively. I was wearing the same outfit. Same large camera. Same everything. I had my room card that I showed him but that wasn't good enough. He made a scene with another security guard and brought me to the front desk of the sister property Bavaro Palace. ", "I was uncomfortable the entire time. I was targeted and disrespected. The male employee behind the counter had no sympathy for the poor treatment. Basically saying that the guard is just doing his job and it's my fault for not wearing the wrist band (even though no one instructed me to wear it upon arrival). He also said that how can the security guard possibly remember all the guests? That's why there are wrist bands. If an employee is responsible for the safety of guests, and can't remember one less than 24 hours later, there is a problem. ", "I booked a massage. Upon arrival, another male employee asked what room I was in. I answered thinking it was for a professional reason. Nope.

The atmosphere was relaxing and fun and I appreciated the staff getting participation from the guests, especially for the pool activities. All of the staff were wonderful, except for one. My only complaint is I had an issue with one Valet worker and because of that, I will not be returning to this resort.", "On a previous day, we went to Nicole Boutique with transportation set up by Concierge. A friend we had met on the resort set up the time for transportation. When we had planned to go another day, my friend who did not go with us previously, had inquired the Valet worker about transportation to get there. Instead of directing her to the Concierge personnel (and I was not with her), he had used his personal cell phone to arrange transportation. As we rode, the driver sped past the Nicole Boutique, which I had thankfully remembered and had asked for him to stop at that location but he INSISTED he would take us elsewhere for \"chocolates and cigars.\" After we passed the Nicole Boutique and 2 other sister resorts, that's when I panicked. We were so scared because this driver was taking us to a location against our will! He stopped at a deserted spot with 1 man directing him where to go and the driver also made a phone call. Our disadvantage was we did not understand the language he was speaking and we begged him multiple times to take us back to the resort. He took us to a second location and although that man greeted us enthusiastically, we all agreed to not get out of the car. The driver was upset and demanded we pay $20 if he took us back to the resort because we did not shop there. I'm sure it was a legitimate shop but 1. that was not the place we wanted to go 2. we did not know what was inside that deserted strip mall because looking in that entrance from the car, it was pitch black. After he took us back, I jumped out of the car and demanded to speak to Concierge. I pointed to the Valet worker who \"got\" us the transportation and he had the audacity to hold his hand up as if to tell me to calm down. The Concierge \"alleviated\" the situation by telling us we didn't have to pay the $20 but I do not think the Valet worker got reprimanded as he went about his normal work day. ", "Tips I learned:", "- always go straight to concierge for booking transportation outside of resort", "- do not always trust resort workers for recommendations or help for things outside* of the resort", "- although staying at a resort, do not let that false sense of security blindside you", "- do not upgrade to VIP because it took over 24 hours for my \"cheese and champagne\" to arrive. My friends did not upgrade and got cigars and rum, which I would've preferred anyways"]},

We had a front view of the ocean.  Best room in the entire resort!! The customer service was really wonderful, and we have no complaints. Miguel is who got us the new room and he was great!  I don\u2019t know what our travel agent did other than booking us the \u201choneymoon\u201d package but we were VIP and we did get the two massages, a \u201cromantic\u201d dinner one night at a specialty restaurant and an exclusive area on the beach.  We also got the rum, cigars and beach bag in our room. Everyone thought we were Canadian b/c of our wrist bracelet and we only met two other couples from the US.  Everyone else did seem to be from Canada or Europe.  We went to the sister resorts Casino one night \u2013 don\u2019t waste your time.  We did each play $40 of the resorts money and then $40 of our own but it\u2019s not like it is here in MT.  We could have passed on that.  We did walk around the other sister resort also and it was really nice, but they were not adults only.  The spa at the sister resort looked nicer.  We had our two massages and they were in a little area by the pool separated by some tall bushes between the pool and the beach.  The one downside was they allowed the resort \u201cpeddlers\u201d in this area to try and sell you excursions.  We didn\u2019t like that.  But the massages were wonderful! This resort did have a few people our age (30's), but I\u2019d say about 80% were of retirement age or older. I don't mean to offend anyone they did fun things, but it was definitely not a young crowd. It was quiet which is what we wanted but we felt like the only \u201cyoung\u201d people there haha if that makes sense!  The food was not really that good.  We ate at the buffet and a few of the specialty restaurants.  We would not go back for the food but it was fine.  We made good friends with the pasta guy and the omelet guy haha!  Very small resort and was not crowded.  Also, this is on the Atlantic side so there are waves.  We went to the Caribbean side of the island one day and the water was warmer and no waves."]},

{"hotel": ["Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Nice resort (I\u2019ve stayed at better and worse) but would return"], "content": ["Room: Junior Suite - was a king size bed with pullout trundle type sleeper sofa. The bathroom was a bath with shower as well and double sink vanity. The bathroom ceiling was literally peeling off and falling into the bathtub from the humidity in the room. The humidity was pretty high in room so our towels or suits never completely dried out.  We were on the first floor, next time I would try for a second floor room. We had a few insect issues - cockroaches (about 4 inches in length) and a small lizard. First time we were able to just shoo the lizard and roach out. The second time we had to call the front desk to assist with the roach. They came and sprayed the roach with some insecticide and pushed him out the door.  The minibar had 2 Presidente, 2 Budweiser, assortment of soda and 2 Large bottles of water. When restocked we left a note for extra Presidente, no Budweiser and extra water with $2 tip and they accommodated the request. Housekeeping came very late in day (except on checkout day they attempted to enter at 9AM). Left housekeeping a $5 tip and asked for extra towels and that was accommodated. The room was kept fairly well, a little wear and tear on the furniture with staining but nothing too excessive.  I found it odd that there was no bedding in room for the pull out sleeper. We found that out late in evening when going to bed - but a phone call and about 15 minutes later they brought the bedding and made the bed for us.  The bathroom has a fogged glass between it and the room, so if you turn the bathroom light on in the dark the whole room lights up...which was disruptive for sleeping. ", "Pools: well kept and clean. Only issue was quite a few smokers by the pools. Swim up bar was nice and drinks were quick.  We were always able to find a spot to sit and towels were always available. If we arrived by 10AM we were usually able to get seats right next to pool. ", "Beach: nice beach area, but very busy. Hard to find chairs. Vendors are relentless, especially the ones with animals. Hard to just sit in peace and relax. Bars are too far apart on the beach. I didn\u2019t see any servers on beach either. ", "Restaurants: Buffet offered nearly the exact same food every day which was disappointing, but there was quite a bit of variety. One morning in the buffet we never had a server greet us or bring us drinks. Other than that, the service in the buffets was good. Steakhouse and Italian were impossible for us to get into. So we never got the chance, they said an hour wait but we waited longer and no updates so turned pager in. Attempted a few mornings to get the Japanese reservation but was never able to secure that. Basically Guest Services said if you\u2019re not in line at 7AM there\u2019s no chance. I am on vacation, I am not getting up at 7AM. We did eat at Lola (Spanish Tapas) and at Bamboo (Asian) and they were decent - nothing awesome though. The Sports Bar was 24/7 - order off menu or small buffet in there. The Buffalo Wings off the menu were pretty good. If you asked at any of the restaurants for a kids menu, they never presented one, but would give you standard options like ham & cheese sandwich, chicken tenders, spaghetti and so on. Overall, food was not the best I\u2019ve had at all inclusives. ", "Drinks: Great variety of drinks, all bars seemed to have same menu. The lobby had a specialty drink area in the evenings - one night all types of mojitos (passion fruit was delicious) and another evening Gin and Tonics with the fix-ins. ", "Entertainment: we saw one show that was dancers (a little scantly clad) and singers but a great show. The music in Punta Cana lobby was just one singer, Bavaro had a full band. Both were a nice way to end the evening. ", "Kids Club: we tried it out once. My child seemed to like it but he didn\u2019t ask to go back so we only left him there for an hour one day. My only concern is the front desk was not staffed when we left so I didn\u2019t feel super secure about that. No one watching who was coming or going with who. We did have to sign our child in and out, but like I said no one there to enforce it, seemed like an honesty policy. ", "Staff: They were fairly friendly, English sometimes was spotty for them but able to get by with conversational Spanish. We didn\u2019t have the wow experience that some talk of, no one really stuck out to us. We tipped and it seemed appreciated but not like in other AI Resorts where they remember you and just bring you your beverages without asking.  Lobby Staff were always helpful in person. When we had to call Lobby a few times, they were not good experiences - once disconnected after they answered, multiple times no answer...so better to go in person. Check-in process as well as check-out were very quick.", "Love the wristbands. They are like ribbon material. I could barely tell I was wearing it and no unpleasant scratches. ", "Overall, I would stay here again. I\u2019ve stayed at nicer resorts and not as nice - so this falls somewhere in the middle for me. Would hope for a better kept room where ceiling paint wasn\u2019t falling on me as I showered. Also, I would like to know what it takes to be able to secure a seat at the Steak House and Italian restaurant.

Food was average for the most part but we particularly enjoyed the Italian themed buffet and the Valentine's Day gala themed buffet - way beyond expectations. Also the Italian restaurant was very good but unfortunately we did not like the Fondue restaurant at all - not really our style. We were appalled by the number of guests who left their towels/belongings on the chairs around the pool that had a palapa to \"hold\" their spots. I noticed security removed the items from chairs where no one was present but only before 8:00 a.m. and not on a consistent basis (we saw them come around only twice during the week we were there). They due note in the check-in materials it's now allowed but unless security removes the items on a daily basis this ridiculous habit will continue. I know of a few other couples we spoke with that will not return to this resort because of this. I took note of the people who leave their towels are older adults who should know better  (very juvenile). I can't believe how many people act like they are \"privileged\"and feel they don't have to follow rules. Rules will be broken if they are not enforced so until the resort security team enforces the rules EVERY MORNING this ridiculous behaviour of mature adults will continue (as I've seen at many other resorts we've visited as well). I mean who do you really think you are that you deserve to hold a spot...just because you want it?? If you want a particular spot then get off your ass and sit in the chairs - a few couples actually took turns going to the breakfast buffet to ensure they had a spot, rather than leaving their towels/belongings and then disappearing. Also, if security removes towels from seats not occupied before 8:00 a.m. they need to state this clearly (not just a general statement) and then enforce the rules. Many people will be more appreciative that management is listening - this would be the only fair way for everyone to have an equal opportunity to get the coveted seats they want under a palapa. This was the only thing that turned me off - I speak up and communicate when something isn't right, giving management an opportunity to correct things. Many many others don't want to be confrontational so they just won't return. I also liked the fact that the pool was quiet most of the time. Weather was perfect the entire week and we enjoyed both the beach and pool. Overall had a good time."]},

I strongly recommend it. Despite the small drawbacks (such as a bit too slow check in process, problems with the flush in the toilet, a bit strange solution with a transparent wall in the toilet- there should be some curtain !, some drinks in the mini bar weren't completed daily, sometimes there was definitely too cold in the restaurants) I spent great, relaxing time. Among the things that deserve particular attention are beautiful grounds with extraordinary gardens, beach, swimming pools and great atmosphere. As for food I really recommend la Catedral restaurant, bar in Bavaro lobby and Hemingway bar. Visit in the Bhogali restaurant was a bit disappointing (decor is really nice as well as the staff but some dishes were far from original, Indian flavours). And last but not least- I' m rather not a person who takes part in games, animation activities but during this holiday I participated in the aqua aerobic.

You do not have to wear a wrist band unless you are a 'premium' guest.  The front desk staff is very helpful.  The internet is free in the theater area, but it is essentially worthless.  To check in for our departing flight, the lobby staff were very helpful and allowed us to print out our boarding passes on their hotel printer.  The hotel is very clean and well maintained.  The beach is beautiful with white sugar sand and your feet never get hot. They have security staff all over and it makes you feel safe.  They could improve in a few areas.  As mentioned, the free internet in the theater area is worthless.  If you have a room near the theater, you will hear the music/shows at night.  This is okay, but they need to stop the noise after 10:00 PM which they did not.  The housekeeping staff does not always replace your towels, hand towels and wash clothes.  We had to take some from the cart in the hallway while they were cleaning other rooms.  The breakfasts are buffett style for non-premium members.  The food is often very cold as the heat underneath is insufficient.  You are better off getting and omelette made and sticking to the fresh fruit and cold meats.  The food was decent at the restaurants, but not fantastic.  The Japanese restaurant's food is not worth the reservation or the trip.  Lastly, you get what you pay for.  If you get a good price when you book, don't be surprised that you are on the fourth floor, needing to walk steps as there are no elevators and near the loud music/noise from the theater at night.  If you pay premium prices, you will get a better location and perhaps a ground floor room."]},

Slow line, and they held us hostage for another more than 1/2 hour till someone could check our room to make sure we didn't trash it or steal something.

After reading the negative reviews about this resort all I can say is visit the PC and make your opinion...as I could find very little to complain about at this resort . I find the complaints about the food comical. The while the buffet did have the same food each day...the large volume of food to choose from was enough to insure that you could eat a different meal all week long if you wanted to. In the lunch/supper buffet, the options were numerous including steak made to order and fresh fajita stations. Sports bar buffet selection was sketchy looking but food off the menu was delicious. There was absolutely nothing complain about on the food side things. Drinks were great and staff for the most part were very friendly. A special shout out to Stanley at the lobby pool bar who went absolutely beyond the call of duty to make sure you never hit the bottom of your drink without a fresh one waiting for you. Rooms were very nice and mpdern, with electronic thermostats and maid service signs and smart TVs. I have only 2 complaints about the rooms. The first one is the design of the bathroom. There is a sliding glass door that opens into the bedroom area from the bathroom. When you turn on the light in the bathroom in the middle of the night....it is so bright in the bedroom area that it is tough to sleep . This is such a minute complaint...but it is something I noticed. The second complaint is the water temperature. It was sporadic the whole week... fluctuating between luke warm and freezing cold. Slightly annoying but not a deal breaker. ", "My major complaint about this resort vis one that is totally out of control of the resort itself. I found it totally disgusting the way a certain cross section of guests (I will leave it up to you to take a wild guest where they were from and what language they spoke) treated not only the staff on the resort but also other patrons on the resort. Staff were spoken to like low life servants and basic manners and common sense were thrown out the door when dealing with other resort patrons.

Unfortunately the room we were given this time was more pool view with the ocean view being through the trees. I realize that they don't guarantee a room, but you'd think as a third time visitor our request would carry a bit of weight. Renaldo(?) tried to resolve this, but unforunately there just wasn't anything available any better, but I give him credit for trying", "The resort promotes their policy on not reserving loungers at the pool and beach, but it's worse than ever. At 9:00 a.m I would say 90% of the good chairs around the pool were reserved with towels, however most of those were unoccupied. I saw people going to the beach before sunrise to put towels on the loungers and by 11:00a.m. it was a struggle to find an available one. Unless the resort is going to get over their cowardice and actually enforce their policy, these selfish, self-centered people are going to continue this practice which then forces others to follow suit to get any kind of decent seating.", "The last negative comment is the resort has upgraded(?) their lobby furniture. Unfortunately the chairs aren't really that comfortable and some of the tables are only about 18\" off the ground, so you have lean out of your chair and reach down to get your drink everytime.", "All this said, none of these items detracted from our vacation, so no lost stars and this will always be our first choice when visiting Punta Cana"]},

All the gift shops require credit card or charge to the room which was also disappointing as we brought cash. Tipping was appreciated but not necessary as service was good with or without tipping. Bring a yeti or bubba cup for your drinks you'll be glad you did. The grounds are exceptional and well maintained.

We picked this one because it was small, adults only and appears to have a good beach and reputation. Read many review that varied from great to staff is rude. We seen both. Check in was extremely easy and we were greeted with a smile and a welcome drink. After they took our luggage and told us to walk? seats were available on the cart but two of them came and followed met us at the building to take our luggage up. We didn't know the place nor where we had to go. but one of the manager was waiting near the buffet with a list of new guest and walked us to the room and ensure we had everything. The other couple with us got to walk find their our building and were missing several things. ", "Food was average to bad the first night but I found the buffet got better as the week went until International night. We also went to the Fondue restaurant. Salad was good. we had one of the fondue. Grease tasted old and burnt but every few minutes they would take our fondue forks out of the pot and give us a new one as they were not staying warm. Staff appeared to be in a rush to get us out. Did not enjoy and would no go back to this a la carte. On our first day we were sitting in the lobby and enjoying a drink around 4:30  before going to clean up for supper. A member of the entertainment Juan Carlos came to us and asked us if we support the entertainment. Of course we said yes and we would be coming to see the show that night. He then stood there and started disrespectfully sucking his teeth and staring at us. Then suddenly stated \" find don't support entertainment we'll find somewhere else to do the show\" and started moving the other chair and started to speak Spanish, sounded disrespectful but could not understand. Then we realised that he was clearing the area for some sort of show so we told him instead of being rude he could have just asked us to move so he could clear the area for the show. Turned out the show was not until 21:00 and entertainment did not returned for about 4 hours. He just looked down at us and started to suck on his teeth again. He was rude the rest of the week and I even seen him being totally disrespectful to another guest making a comment about her weight after she passed by him. Coco Bongo came and did a little publicity stunt by the pool one afternoon and passing flyers regarding an evening at the club. After a little speech they threw a couple gifts in the pool a drinking cup and another object I didn't recognized. this same entertainment guy jumped in the pool and grabbed the stuff before a lady that was already in the pool grabbed it. he was later going around with the cup and drinking out of it. One of the manager was cooking crepes at pool side (great treat) and this guy put his cup on the table to grab some food, the manager smelled the cup and did the fact of somebody that just smelled a strong drink, then drank some. So that's why some of them do what ever they want, because they let them.", "Twice during the week they had a bbq on the beach. everytime entertainment was behind the BBQ drinking the sangria that was suppose to be for staff. The first BBQ was great. Very well cook chicken but after 30 minutes there was no line up. so the second time we waited a bit for the line up to be done. We headed to the BBQ to have the cook look right at us, take the plates away that were left filled them with rice and pork chops and all the plates of food was given to staff and the guys running the store on the beach beside the resort. and all that was entertainment were drinking sangria again and eating well, we had to go to the buffet as new plates never came and staff with foam plate came and took all that was left.", "We went to the beach/snack bar in the evening, most of the time we were the only one there the last day finally had about 10 people there. The first night a security guard had to go look for the bartender as she was nowhere to be found, second drink wasn't an option she never came back. That is the bar opened all night??? that's probably why nobody was there. After that we went a few time a big guy was the bartender, I do believe he drank more then we did that night. ", "Now don't get me wrong I stayed at resort that I myself snuck a few drinks to the guys busting their butts off working the grounds. I even took one of the guys hat and shirt one time and swept the sidewalk while he enjoyed a cold beer. at this resort you don't have to worry about it. They are well fed and drink enough. At the wrong time in the morning you have to wait in line behind entertainment to get an eggs  as they all show up at the same time for breakfast. ", "Unfortunately these incident take the focus on a great place. We met some great people and we met guests that were going to this resort for the 13th year in a row. All the staff that came and greeted them were not the clowns we seen everywhere. These were good staff that worked their  had to make it pleasant for us. One was the greater at the buffet, her name was Raysa (sorry for the spelling) she was always smiling, pleasant, hugging guest, high fives, hand shake and always acknowledged you when you left.", "If you needed change for any bills 5 to 100, the front desk would always have change and were always smiling and helpful. ", "we did have a few issue with the room cleaning. We were told due to the orange band from sunwing that we were VIP and would get this and that, but were not getting any of it. one chat to the Sunwing rep Leo, everything changed and we had no issues.", "Great looking room, only issue was no dresser and not a lot of hangers. I don't like living out of my suitecase. I'm one of those people that puts everything in the dressers and closets as I like to feel at home on vacation not going through my suitcase looking for socks or anything. The Dalvin at the pool bar was always smiling and serving as fast as he could. Many days they had Dalwin by himself serving drink at both the pool bar upper and lower bar. He could barelly keep up but did his best. Yet we would go to that beach bar after supper and one time they had 3 bartender for 4 people. Lack of management will kill thise place if they don't get a grip on these few staff that unfortunately are the one you remember the most because you pay good money not to have a few bad apple make you think there is no way I'm going to this place again. Not at that price."]},

Had to call multiple times to get freah towels. ", "Food: The food was just okay, nothing to write home about. Some of my party stomachs were messed up the entire trip. The service in the restaurants were good, but they moved pretty slow with breakfast beverages. The Italian resturant was horrible, the service was not great, the food was nasty, we were giving 2 menus for 8 people, we got up and walked out. ", "Final thoughts: I will not be back to this resort, they need better entertainment and daily activities, organization and update their rooms. They also need to keep the pools open later than 6pm. One thing i did enjoy was most of the employees were nice and friendly. They need to invite more people to the club and play more of a variety of music so that its enjoyed by everyone."]},

The staff were highly professional - from the bartenders to the maids and most of all their customer service representative Hilda. All staff seemed to be generally enthusiastic about their jobs, very evident in their demeanor. Each morning I would have a special smoothie made with kiwi, pineapple and banana - the lady was most accommodating and remembered my order and always greeted me with her lovely smile, clearly letting me know she was set to \"whip up\" my morning ritual drink. Her service was exemplary and we were happy to tip her, the omelette chef and the servers especially Francesca. As this trip included Cheryl's birthdate, the staff were fantastic. They set up a wonderful surprise dinner at the fondue restaurant, in addition to decorating our room, which incidentally was the most spectacular room we have stayed in after years of travelling. Our room afforded us a welcome fruit basket, stocked mini fridge, a complementary bottle of DR rum and a sample box of cigars. In addition, the room had both a hot tub and the very best possible view of the beach and the pool. FYI it was room 4223. Another highlight was the well stocked gym which thanks to my workouts allowed me to enjoy those cervezas guilt free...on those rainy days. A special treat was in the Princess Caribe next door which had a coffee shop called \"La Creperie\" be sure to check it out as it is included in your stay.

The hotel campus was clean and employees friendly. They only had one pool, but with the limited guests in this period, there was no competition for seats. Guests could visit the other affiliated hotels in the area to use their facilities if so desired. They kept their beach clean of seaweed, and the sand extended well into the ocean making water play enjoyable.  Swimming areas were marked keeping boats out of the area, reducing the risk of a swimmer being run over.  While our room was generally acceptable, our bathroom was poorly designed with the toilet roll bar positioned to strike your elbow while sitting on the throne.  ", "There was limited room for movement.  The hotel restaurant food was just passible. The hotel entertainment consisted of the same 5 dancers changing their routines, and one evening of gymnasts who were quite good, albiet not polished.", "We took two Nexus tours, one to the capital, Santo Dominica, the second to snorkle at Catalina Island.  We were picked up at 6 am for the first tour, only to wait for more than an hour at the collection point to board the bus.  Further, the tour skipped many of the sights, only driving by them with the guide hand waving a brief description. Strongly recommend doing some research, renting a car and doing the exploring on your own.  The snorkeling on the second trip was great, but for those of us that dip below the surface, plastics were evident among the coral.  Sadly the boats provided no provisions such as netted bags to facilitate removal of the plastic.  The section of the beach where we took a break was crowded, disorganized when moving the guests off and onto the boats, and for those that were swimming, there was a significant risk of being hit by a boat while they moved the guests."]},

Rooms are large, large patios, we stayed in the deluxe suite with ocean view and were very happy.   Large balcony, comfortable bed and lots of supplies. Very Clean.  The resort is small, 5 buildings of rooms.  You can walk from the lobby to the beach in a few minutes so nothing far from any room.   The pool is very nice with a swim up bar and the grounds are immaculate.  The staff are friendly and helpful and you feel very safe.  There is an awesome beach bar with 24 hour service, very cool right close to the ocean and you can have a nice drink and hear the waves. The beach is perfect and because the property is small there is never a need to save a Chair or day bed by the pool or beach.   Also you don\u2019t need reservations to the 4 a la carts on-site and its always easy to get in. Getting a reservation at the sister property is also easy. Sounds great right? If that is all that matters other that free flowing cold drinks you will love it here.  ", "However, for some of us there is more.   The wine is undrinkable.  The liquor is the cheapest of brands.  You can purchase decent types for an up charge only.  Which defeats the all inclusive concert for me.   ", "The food is average at best.  While the a la carts are decor and service are great the food is not.  Usually cold, bland and well just the worst I have had at any all inclusive except maybe in Cuba.  Probably a tie.  Highlights are the Salmon and Lasagna at the Italian and Beef at the Asian and chicken at the beach bar.  And that is it.  We tried them all.

My partner and I really enjoyed our stay here, however it's really evident that this is not a 5* hotel for a number of reasons. Compared to the 5* you get in Europe, it doesn't really match up. However for value and location it's amazing.", "Rooms - 3* at best. They were really basic and felt very very dated, as echoed by the rest of the reviews. The rooms are the reason I wouldn't return to this hotel. However, the pressure in the shower was great and the rooms were clean. The maid came every day without fail and swept through the whole room. They don't tidy, just clean around your mess, so I would recommend tidying up before they come. The iron is awful, actually burnt through my partner's shirt and leaked water everywhere - but we may have just got a dodgy one.", "Service - Interesting! Some people were extremely friendly but I found generally most were quite moody, especially if you couldn't speak Spanish - even if you tried! We pre-booked a private transfer both ways. On the way home we didn't have any dollars left over and were made to feel really uncomfortable by the porter when we couldn't tip. As a result the transfer bus actually dropped us at the wrong terminal, telling me it was B when actually it was A. I'm not sure you can call yourself a 5* hotel when you make people feel uncomfortable for not tipping. Pay your staff more!!!!", "Food - Generally good, I couldn't fault it. I did have a dodgy stomach at one point but that could've been anything. Choices at lunch and breakfast got a bit repetitive, but that could be said for anywhere. Burgers at lunch were brilliant! Our Favourite restaurants were Kyoto and Chez Gourmet - the Hibachi at Kyoto was absolutely fantastic, I feel so lucky to be able to experience that! Dolce Vita was really poor - the setting was bright and had a bit of a canteen feel. Food wasn't great either. We also tried La Comedie which was brilliant - loved the atmosphere and food was fabulous too! La Brisa and La Fuente were also great. La Brisa more relaxed than the other.", "If you are premium make sure you book ALL your restaurants before you get there via email as we did, then you get to experience them all!", "Drinks - As other reviews, get yourself a reusable cup from the shop for your drinks by the pool/beach - save the planet and don't use the little plastic cups! The alcohol is not premium at all (even if you are), and the pool bar staff are the grumpiest people I have come across, and I am British! There's a lack of drinks service on the beach - again this would add up to 5* if it were there. Overall though, any drink you wanted was available and there was an a la carte menu for better wines if you were willing to pay extra!", "Location - Perfection is all I can say about this. It really was amazing. I have seen many beautiful beaches in my time, and this was definitely up there with the best. Adults Only was much more relaxing than the other side. But when we did go over to the other side it was only a 10 minute walk, I don't see the necessity for a train personally... We walked up and down the beach most days and it was brilliant. Not much to see snorkelling but still amazing.", "Premium - we payed extra for premium and it included Wifi and access to any restaurant. We also got massages each. I think generally it was worth it and made our stay more enjoyable from that perspective without a big old bill at the end!", "Entertainment - We are British so didn't get involved to much with this! haha. But the Burlesque show was fabulous as was the circus. MJ tribute felt a bit weird all things considered but otherwise can't fault it if that's what you're after.", "Overall - Very good considering what a large operation they are running! Drunken teenagers were awash on the other side, however it sounds as though they had much much better rooms, so really depends what you are on holiday for. If you're after a beautiful beach and a huge resort and won't spend much time in your room, then go for it. But learn some Spanish and be prepared for a lesser service if you don't tip!"]},

There is a kids club for the children with playground, video games, board games and activities for children. There is also a Play Room with pool tables, video games and ping pong table (that adults used as well). Pool/beach activities were fun! Zumba, water polo, dance lesson...so much to do! We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning, very fresh, fruit, juice and a variety of food, eggs, bacon, pastries, omelette made to order. We never made it to lunch to see what was offered because we spent most of our time at the pool and beach.

{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Amazing vacation!"], "content": ["This was my boyfriends first vacation (and one of many for me) so it was very important to me that we were well taken care of for his first experience. We booked through sunwing, which I would highly recommend for any vacation as it makes everything simple and you are given a bunch of bonuses that they don't advertise. To begin, the shuttle from the airport was clean and spacious, and when we arrived the bell boy was very helpful and friendly. We were given a welcome drink while checking in with the front desk staff, who were also very helpful throughout our trip (and can split your $20 bills into $1s!). The first night we ate at the buffet because we didn't have time for an a la carte meal, and we were amazed by the selection and quality of the buffet food. I have been to many resorts before and this kne had the best food by far! (Which we weren't expecting, being in the Dominican). There was a wide selection of meat, fish, fruit, potatoes, pasta, dessert, you name it! Couldn't have been happier with the buffet and they had a different theme every night! The service in the buffet was also good for thr entire vacation, however we did get forgotten a couple of times, which we didn't mind because it is mostly self serve anyway! They gave us a special table for my birthday at my boyfriends request, and were always trying to seat you in the best location possible. We also wish we discovered earlier that the mediterranian restaurant is open as a snack bar throughout the day! Our room was big and beautiful, with an amazing view from the balcony. We were unsure about being on the ground floor at first, but it turned out to be great to not have to do stairs every day! The bell boy drops your bags off at your room for you, so you don't have to try to pull them across the pathways. Our air conditioning worked great and we had to turn it off some nights because it was getting too cold. There were some mosquitos around the resort at night, but nothing that a little bug spray didn't fix. They also offered to fumigate our room if needed, which we kindly declined because we didn't see any mosquitos in our room. The maids did a fantastic job, and mopped our floor every time they came in to pick up all the sand, which in turn made the bed less sandy than I've experienced elsewhere. The bars were all well-stocked and bartenders friendly! The animation staff were incredible and definately entertained us throughout the day and at night. But if yiu want to just relax you can also go lay on the beach and soak up the sun. There are a few vendors on the beach that try to talk to you but they were pretty good about leaving you alone if you say no. It was also nice to have access to the other 2 Princess resorts, which are easily accessible via the beach or a shuttle from the front lobby. My boyfriends favourite part about the resort was the a la carte restaurants. There is a steakhouse, italian, mediteranian and fondue on this resort, and many others on the other resorts that you can go to if you make a reservation the day before with guest services. We tried all the restaurants on our resort and then the brazillian on the other Princess resort. All of the restaurants served amazing food with great service. There was even a small band that would go table to table and play a song you requested. The steak was amazing and the fondue was the best I have had. Overall the food was very impressive and the service was great as well! The little shops on the resort are a little overpriced but they have everything you would need (sunscreen, medicine, etc.). I got sick on the last day of our trip, I think maybe from accidentally swallowing some tap water. I was able to get pepto bismol from the shop (but it was $20usd!) so I would recommend bringing some pepto or other medicines just incase! Anyway, the pool was very clean and warm, and the ocean was even warmer than the pool! They keep the beach pretty clean at the resort however if you walk down the beach there is alot of seaweed but it is beautiful! The ocean here was pretty wavy, so you might want to bring something to float on if you are going out past where you can touch. This was my first experience at an adults-only resort and I was pleasantly suprised by how much more relaxing the trip was without children around. The only thing I wish we did before travelling here was learn some Spanish. There are a lot of Spanish speaking employees and other guests, so I wish we had taken the time to learn some basic Spanish before travelling here! Overall our vacation was great and it convinced my boyfriend that maybe travelling isn't so bad. We will be back!!   "]},

All of the bathrooms around the lobbies, pool and property were extremely well kept and clean. I have been to many 5 star resorts and this one was by far the cleanest when it came to the public washrooms. ", "The buffet food was the only achilles heel. While what food was presented was good, there wasn't a home fried potato to be seen at breakfast for the entire week.

But not all of them are open every night, because this side is smaller they sometimes shut one of them down to funnel people to the others to reduce waste. We tried the Swiss fondue, the Italian, the Chinese and the Tex Mex. All were great, the Tomato basil soup in the Italian restaurant is without doubt the best myself or my wife have ever tasted. The steak in the Tex Mex was perfectly cooked.", "The best part of our vacation was having two members of the staff accompany us in their off hours to go and watch a Dominican Winter League Baseball game in La Romana between the Toro's and Licey. If you like baseball you must see a Dominican Winter League game. The experience is nothing like North America. Dominicans are very passionate baseball fans and the stadium was rocking loud comparable to a gold medal hockey game. These games are not expensive, normally 18.00 US to sit behind the dugout. We got there late and bought our tickets from a scalper, we paid $30.00 US for seats not 8 rows behind the dugout. The winning pitcher for the Toro's is a Blue Jays drafted prospect. Many of the players are either currently playing MLB or prospects. This league is their off season training. This baseball is much better than the North American minor leagues. It was a great game and we had a blast with our new Dominican friends. Talk to Nieves at client services she really knows her baseball and she is a big fan. If she cannot make it to the game with you she will definitely go out of her way to make it happen for you. We have been to several games and have never had a security issue. Last but not least a special shout out to Emilio the Lobby bartender, this man will have you rolling in the isles with laughter, great guy with a huge character and Nelson at the pool bar, he is the doctor that will help you with your daily ales.

However, our experience at this resort was awesome! We did not upgrade to premium level, but we did not feel we needed to. Our room was in building #4 and we were on the first floor with a great view of the ocean. Everything is in walking distance. We liked being at the adults side but still having access to the Palace, we walked over to that side every day and it is an easy walk on the beach, sidewalk or even could take the train if needed. The pool and beach were fabulous and even though there is not a swim up bar on the adults side, the staff at the pool were always there making sure we had a cocktail in our hand, so we were well taken care of! We ate at the buffets on the adults side as well as the Palace. Omelet bar on the adults side was a plus on the adults side! We only made reservations at Coral Seafood, Sante Fe steakhouse and La Brisa. I had the lobster at Coral and I thought it was great. But then had it also at La Brisa and it was even better. The meals and quality of meat at Sante Fe was also exceptional. ", "We took advantage of the complimentary non motorized sports at the Palace and took the 4 person catamaran out one day, I would recommend that! We also played a round at the golf course. Unfortunately we played the day there was a HUGE brush fire right out side the course so we could only play 9 holes and could not go to that side of the course for our safety. We were bummed, but understood and were given a voucher to come back. Bummer we never did make it back, but wish we would have as the course was beautiful.

{"hotel": ["Barcelo Bavaro Beach Adults Only"], "title": ["Great Resort Property; Food Mediocre"], "content": ["In short: The resort is lovely! Ocean is picture-perfect. (sometimes quite a bit of seaweed though) Pool is divine! Spa is tiny but adequate. Food is poor to mediocre. Drinks are ok. Wind picks up in the afternoon so best tanning hours are definitely first thing in the morning until early afternoon. Our visit (during spring break) had a completely different vibe and clientele than our visit in February (Best Valentine's Day Ever!) Much more of a frat party scene and super crowded with college kids. Not so relaxing. Depending on the vibe you want, pick travel dates accordingly.", "If you want to completely relax, chill at the pool, nap on the beach or yoga in solitude with a gorgeous backdrop, this is the perfect resort. It's the kind where you want to stay on the property and let time stand still. There is plenty to do, plus the poolside massage therapist on adults-only side is outstanding.", "I highly encourage a ground floor beach front room. It is most certainly worth it! My other room had a balcony overlooking a garden which is fine but the ground floor ocean front with easy access to the beach was so much better. Just waltz right out the sliding glass door and voila! We were premium level both times and I highly suggest that. Super easy check-in/check-out and delightful staff.  If you want a choice time or specific restaurant for dinner, book your dining options before you arrive as they sell out. We just settle for whatever is available as we are on no schedule but sometimes that means dinner at 10pm. We haven't found the food to be great so we are usually in no hurry for it. Chez gourmet serves fancy french on the adults-only side. It is very underwhelming but footsteps away. Desert was actually terrible and neither the entree nor the desert were prepared traditionally. No flamb\u00e9e, No sizzle and No fun! Also tried Seafood eatery on family side (a long but delightful walk or take the shuttle) and we left wishing we never ordered the lobster. Just bring your own snacks. We actually prefer both buffet options on adults side over the reservation-required restaurants. And although they say to dress for dinner, you can wear whatever you want apparently, as cut-off jean shorts and men's tee shirts were rampant."]},
{"hotel": ["Barcelo Bavaro Beach Adults Only"], "title": ["Would not recommend "], "content": ["We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Barcelona B\u00e1varo Beach and will not be returning back. Our whole stay wasn\u2019t horrible but we had a lot of experiences that stood out as bad and very few that stood out as good. Below is a long review but I think it is so important to explain our experience because I always use TripAdvisor to book our trips and many of the reviews I read were not comparable to our experience at the resort. I also want to mention that I have traveled for many years and this is the first time that I have taken the time to leave a bad review.", "The grounds: The resort as a whole looked beautiful from the outside and the pools and grounds were kept up with fairly well. The beaches do have a bit of seaweed but that\u2019s to be expected. The grounds really were beautiful at the Palace next door, as it seemed much newer and more grand.", "The food: We have stayed at all inclusive resorts before and I think it\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019re never going to have a 5 star gourmet dining experience unless you are paying good money for a resort that is known for its dining experiences. That being said, the food at this resort was below caliber even when it comes to all inclusive resorts. I\u2019ll start by saying that within 24 hours my husband was very sick to his stomach. Based on the fact that neither of us drank the water, he either got sick from the cold cut meats in the premium level lounge or from his fish dinner at La Chez. Needless to say, he was in bed for about 20 hours straight. My steak at La Chez was actually my best meal and was honestly comparable to a $30-$40 steak in the US. Breakfast at the buffet was always a good meal because we could have eggs made fresh and I loved the Nutella crepes! I would suggest never eating anything that is not prepared in front of you because there is no telling how long it has been out. The coffee machines made good coffee although the whole coffee area smelled like vomit or spoiled milk our last day. The lunch buffet was enough to make you lose your appetite and it was very hard to find anything worth eating. We missed our second night\u2019s dinner reservation at La Brisa because my husband was sick so I called to order room service at 10:50pm (dinner menu stopped being served at 11pm). The room service line was busy for a few minutes so I called premium level and they told me I couldn\u2019t order from the dinner menu even though it was still before 11. After calling room service again and speaking to someone before 11, they allowed me to order from the dinner menu( my steak was decent). Our third night at La Comedie was absolutely disgusting. The whole restaurant smelled like sewage which immediately made us lose our appetite. I ordered the same steak as I did at La Chez but it wasn\u2019t as good of a cut of meat at all. My husband ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu. Neither of us ate much because of the smell. His strawberry ice cream tasted like children\u2019s bubble gum toothpaste. Our last dinner at Kyoto was the best mostly because the restaurant didn\u2019t smell awful and seemed clean. We weren\u2019t able to sit at hibachi so you couldn\u2019t order anything but Fried rice or Udon noodle bowls as your main course but by that point, we would take anything we could. Our service at Kyoto was by far the best also. They actually smiled and checked on us! Another huge issue I had was that upon arrival (in the premium level lounge), without telling us about any of the restaurants, they asked which restaurants we were expecting to eat at then gave us two out of our 4 night stay and told us everything else was booked. The only way we got reservations every night was because I showed up every day and told them we were willing to eat at 9:45 every night. The only way we got the Japanese restaurant was because I went next door to the palace\u2019s premium level lounge and begged. (You\u2019ll do anything when you haven\u2019t eaten much for 3 days.) ", "The guest rooms: Our room was comparable to a 3 star hotel at best. The bathrooms were gross (grout was dirty and stained and bathtub was stained brown. Glass on shower desperately needed to be wiped down with some cleaner) and the rest of the room was just dated. I would highly suggest the sea view as it really was beautiful! The room was not swept daily. The vent cover on our bathroom ceiling completely fell out our last night and although we called premium level and asked for maintenance they never showed. We eventually just tried to jam it back up there and hope it stayed until we checked out the next morning. ", "The service:  I have a background of working in hotels as a career so I hate giving bad reviews because I know many of the staff are working very hard, but there just seemed to be a culture at the property of never doing more than what had to be done. I fully understand the language barrier but a smile is universal and can go a long ways. Unfortunately, we saw very few smiles. I understand how much work is put into being a service provider in the hospitality industry so I always tip well. That being said, I think a great tip is warranted by great service rather than great service only happening because you tip prior to receiving service. It was almost if you could only get a good answer if you tipped or badgered enough. (We were told that there weren\u2019t reservations for a massage on a certain day so we spoke to 3 people who all gave us different answers and somehow the last one found us multiple options for an appointment first try.) I also want to mention that we rode back in a shuttle with someone who spoke English and Spanish and she mentioned that she had a few instances of overhearing staff making fun of people in Spanish because they did not know she could speak it fluently.

The entertainment team was outstanding.  Not only did they offer fun silly games in the afternoon,  but every night they put on a show. The amount of dancing these men and women did with the energy they have made me tired just  watching them.  All of the workers seemed very happy. By the 3rd day the lady greeting us for  meals figured out we had a particular table we liked. Even one of the bartenders sang one night with the show was a surprise.  The drinks were all great and we had most of what was offered. My favorite was Banana hama. The trips we planned with the guides in the lobby were awesome.  Got covered in mud from head to toe on dune buggy adventure. Do not recommend excursions with the dive shop on the beach. We did a shark stingray snorkeling trip that did not live up to my expectations.  The water was murky with the sharks you could barely see them below you. The stingray was cool even got to touch it. The snorkeling was difficult the ocean was extra choppy that day. Was supposed to be at a reaf I did not see a reaf. The staff on our boat were very attentive though. My husband got caught in a rip tide and they noticed and literally saved him from drowning.  For that we are so grateful!!!! The resort staff as a whole just amazing.  Seemed like they work 7 days a week.  Towards the end of our trip my husband suffered terrible nose bleeds. He's never had them before.  Figured may have been related to him trying to drink the ocean.  But, anyways he made a huge mess as 2 of them started in his sleep.  I mean our room looked like we slaughtered an animal in there. I cleaned the floor each time, but the mess on the towels and sheets was immense.  I took pictures and showed them to the front desk we were offering to pay for the sheets and towels (I am sure they had to be thrown away). They were not worried just said they would change them out soon for us and they did.  The one part I would change is there was a vendor at the pool that was like a sniper. They were right by the bathroom and were very good at catching you. I went to the bathroom the 2nd day there and came back with $200 worth of stuff. No was not a word they understood and you could not get away from them unless you bought something.  And then they kept adding to your stuff bundling it. Then the price negotiations began.  We will be back was a great value for the cost of the trip.  Plus now I  know how to avoid that vendor by walking on the beach around them."]},

As it was now late, and we were tired from a day of travel, we decided to wear our flip-flops during the night if we need the facilities and report it in the morning, which we did. Maintenance came to fix the leaky A/C which was causing the problem. The pool of water returned, so another call was made for more maintenance.

We weren\u2019t disappointed, but didn\u2019t enjoy the resort as much as our first time. We were a group of 7 travellers.", "Barcelo Bavaro Beach is the adults only section of the Barcelo Bavaro Grand resort in Punta Cana. It consists of 6 buildings, 4 buildings to the left of the lobby and 2 buildings to the right. The adults only section is very compact, but the remainder of the resort is huge.", "Check-in was efficient, but it wasn\u2019t busy when we arrived; meaning, not one other guest ahead of us. We did witness a busy check-in time with a very long line of guests waiting later the same day. It didn\u2019t look too bad, but it wasn\u2019t very fast either. They seem to have an issue with having rooms ready by 3pm. We arrived late morning so we didn\u2019t expect the rooms to be ready. We were told to come back after 3pm to get our rooms, so off to enjoy the day we went. Back at 3:30, rooms still not ready. Checked multiple times after that, still not ready. Finally, after pushing back a little we finally got our rooms at 6pm. This is in stark contrast to our first stay here 6 years ago. Rooms weren\u2019t ready at 3pm then either, but they actually came looking for us when the room was finally ready. Oh, and the room was ready by 3:30 6 years ago which was much more reasonable. This obviously needs improvement, especially if you want to go to an A La Carte the night of arrival. ", "Room is still very basic, but very nice. The guest rooms really need some TLC. The room was clean, but the years are showing for sure and they need to be upgraded completely. Room had a mini-fridge that was re-stocked daily, for the most part. Re-stocking was hit and miss with what they would refill. Not sure why, but some times they just didn\u2019t refill all that was used. Same with coffee supplies in the room, rarely restocked, and when it was they didn\u2019t restock everything", "Water pressure was very good in the shower, and there was always hot water available anytime during the day, but the water temperature fluctuated hot/cold while taking showers. There were a couple short power outages while we were there (again, same as 6 years ago), no water pressure when the power is out.", "Bed was very comfortable, with 3 different sized pillows to choose from. Air-conditioning worked very well and was fully controllable, unlike some other resorts we have been to where you could not adjust the temperature.", "We stayed in building 2, top floor, close to the beach about 4 rooms from the end of the building. View from the balcony was fantastic, great view of the beach and partial view of the pool.", "This resort only has 2 bars, the lobby bar and the pool bar, no swim-up bar in the pool. Service and drinks at both were very good.", "There are 2 restaurants here, the main buffet and Chez Gourmet which is an A La Carte restaurant (reservations are required for Chez Gourmet, dress code applies). There is also a restaurant located between Barcelo Bavaro Beach and Barcelo Bavaro Palace (just outside the mini-suites section) called La Brisa. This restaurant is a buffet for lunch, and A La Carte in the evening. Reservations are required for evening dining, dress code applies. This restaurant is located right on the beach, view was breath-taking. This was and still is our favorite place for lunch.", "There were other restaurants available over at Barcelo Bavaro Palace, reservations required for them all.", "I would like to make a quick mention of the restaurant at the golf course. They offer a buffet breakfast and lunch, and in the evening it is an A La Carte, the food is fantastic here. This restaurant was a hidden gem 6 years ago and still is.", "Food at all the restaurants was very good. We dined at Chez Gourmet one night, the steak house (over at Palace), and the Japanese dinner show (Over at Palace). All meals were great. Service at the steak house was a little slow, but this is Dominican time! The food at the buffets was just as good as our last stay. A lot of variety and quality was good. Service was decent at the buffet, just one morning where our server didn\u2019t come over to offer coffee, we had to ask after about 10 minutes.", "Reservations are required for the A La Cartes, and this is where the resort falls way short. 6 years ago we were able to reserve our A La Cartes prior to arrival. We left that with our travel agent this year, but something went wrong and the reservations were not arranged. Not the resorts fault, but, pretty much all of the restaurants were fully booked unless we wanted to have a really late supper. We did manage to get one at the Japanese dinner show and another at the steak house for just my wife and I, but Chez Gourmet was a no go. However, we heard a rumor from some other guests that if you go right at opening, they\u2019ll usually allow you to dine. Luckily we managed to get in on our last night. When all the restaurants are fully booked on your arrival day there is an obvious issue that needs to be addressed. ", "Beach is beautiful here. Water has some beautiful colors, but the water doesn\u2019t have a lot of waves so if you prefer a more active wavy beach, this is not it. There are plenty of beach loungers available, the beach area is more than enough for the number of guests at the resort. The reserving of loungers is the same here as at most other resorts. However, there are so many loungers you can still find one pretty much anytime of day. ", "Pool is a good size, but not a lot of loungers around the pool. We witnessed quite a few people moving loungers from the beach to the pool. We did before as well, not a problem to do so. They have pool service available, but usually just as easy to go to the bar yourself. Pool temp was very a little on the cool side this year. Pools are not heated at any resort that I know of in Punta Cana, so you gets what you gets for the time of year you travel! Pool had a number of in-water loungers, as well as a jacuzzi air-jet section in the middle of the pool and a few shower heads that blasted water from above which provided a fantastic massage.", "The resort offered WIFI service you could purchase. We decided to stay disconnected this year so we didn\u2019t purchase it this time. From what we could tell, the wifi worked well all over the resort.", "I also have a number of videos I will be posting on youtube in the near future. Search for my channel on youtube (fan1080)."]},
{"hotel": ["Barcelo Bavaro Beach Adults Only"], "title": ["Awful!!  Would not recommend."], "content": ["We reserved a room at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach (adults only) for 3/25-31.  We were told we would have full access to the Barcelo Bavaro Palace, plus the additional pool and restaurants on our side.  Turns out we had to pay an additional $15-30 for 5 of the main restaurants.  Room service was not included, what??  This is an all inclusive resort.  Obviously not!!  They put us in the furthest room from the other property.  We had a 1 mile walk to BBP.  The rooms at BBB are incredibly dated.  No ocean view.  The blow dryer only worked if you held the button down while using it.  Then there is the issue of the buffets.  The food at the buffet was disgusting!  We had trouble finding something edible for breakfast and lunch.  The restaurants were fine if you can get in.  We spend an hour trying to get dinner reservations and only got 4 of the 5 nights, and not even at the restaurants we wanted.  We were given a $1000 resort credit.  But, it can only be used as a 25% off a few things.  On our itinerary it stated that it could be used on WiFi, but when we asked, they said their policy said it wasn't part of the resort credit.  WiFi is $40, another rip off.  I went to the spa, when I finished with my massage I got ready for dinner in the locker room (since my room was a mile away) dinner was in the main area of BBP.  I asked for a blow dryer and was told they don't have one.  I asked at the front reception area and was told no, finally they were able to find one in the salon next door that I could use, but could not take to the locker room.  How accommodating!?!  On the bright side, the beaches are well maintained and beautiful.  The bartenders are friendly.  The casino staff are NOT friendly.  The blackjack dealers are very crabby.  We stayed here a few years ago with a better vacation, but this was our last.  We have stayed at much nicer, updated, accommodating resorts and will be giving them our business from now on."]},

The Hamburgers did not taste like real meat. As far as the alcohol, it was of very poor quality also and the \u201cbartenders\u201d couldn\u2019t mix a drink to save their lives. Smirnoff vodka was considered top shelf which incurred an extra charge, so you can only imagine the cheap vodka used for the all inclusive package. I had to pay for bottles of wine to get a decent drink. Furthermore, there was only one bartender that worked both the pool bar and swim up bar. So, you often had to wait 10-15 minutes just for the bartender to appear at the swim up bar. Communication between staff members and staff and guests were seriously lacking, there was no schedule, and nobody seemed to know information about what went on at the resort.  Also lacking was the entertainment. It didn\u2019t start at the pool until almost 3pm and consisted of some aerobics and a few games. Then some music. Same music every single day. Boring! But the first five hours at the pool had nothing going on. The bars were dead at night. I was beyond bored. I would not return to this resort if offered a free trip.

Transfer to the hotel was fast and hassle free.", "On arrival at ours, we were immediately greeted with smiling faces, a cold damp flannel (perfect) and a lovely welcoming drink. It made us feel very special straight away. We were offered an upgrade package but politely turned it down. I\u2019d rather see what the basic package consisted of after reading some other reviews.", "Once checked in, we were taken by \u201cbus\u201d to our room, even though it was less than 200 yards away. The bell-boy dropped in our luggage and didn\u2019t hang around looking for a tip..nice touch, very professional.", "The room was very spacious, clean and, more importantly, cool without any damp or musty smell.

The food selection was vast and catered to every taste. Beautifully cooked, well presented and lots of it. The snack bar restaurant by the beach has less selection, but again the food was perfect for grazing on. The Swiss restaurant, \u201cLa Petite Fondue\u201d was a new, and pleasant experience for us.

Well, they certainly know how to treat you here..!! As soon as you enter the buffet restaurant, you receive a welcome drink (evening time) and are escorted to your table. The waiters are soon with you with jugs of water and take your drinks orders quickly.

My wife returned to the hotel very late that night on her own. The Monday morning, Alexander spoke to her, asking where I was and when she told him, he immediately phoned the hospital for an update, relaying information to her. Once done, he phoned my room and gave the phone to Sue so she could talk to me. Several times that morning he called for an update, putting Sue\u2019s mind at ease, although we were both worried that we might miss the flight home. He then arranged a later check out for us just in case I wasn\u2019t back by 1200hrs. He told Sue that if the hospital made me stay, he would sort a room for us for as long as necessary. When I did return, just after midday, he greeted me warmly and left me in no doubt that all would be well. ", "I honestly cannot thank the staff enough.

Hopefully it was just the slow season and not a sign that this resort is fading.  Animation team did a lot of work keeping people busy. The first couple days they didn't really do too much but by the end they were at it in full force.  Activities and games that were always fun to watch and participate in.. especially when winning a bottle of rum. Evening entertainment was a little lame . Other resorts we have been to have entertainment groups that are brought into the resort a few nights a week and fill in the other nights with their own animation team . But here the animation team does it almost every night.  I'm sure if you were there for 2 weeks or more it would be pretty repetitive.  I do realize the entertainment next door is available to us but it's not much better.  Didn't attend the Arieto disco this year but have in the past.

The fondue restaurant was not too bad but stay away from the cheese fondue, Not good imo.", "   The only other thing I would say they could have done better was to recognize special occasions. Leading up to our trip I emailed the resort several times explaining we were celebrating our wedding anniversary ( and gave them the date) and that we had been there 2 other times to celebrate our anniversary. So It would have been nice if they acknowledged that during our stay. At the very least a note in our room or something... but nothing. Not a huge deal but would have made our day.

I read where others said they don't appreciate tips...this is false!! They do appreciate them and you should always take care of them!! Luiza, Wanda, Winny always took great care of our group!!"]},

The omelets and coffee were delicious!  However, we didn't like the Italian restaurant. It took forever to be greeted once we were seated and then our appetizer came out cold. To top if off, the Tiramisu wasn't tiramisu at all! Our room didn't have a working dead bolt lock and hairdryer, but when we asked, they came and fixed it. ", "Our favorite part was the beach. We arrived early to get seats under the umbrella and stayed all day. The service was great. We especially liked our servers, Ricardo, Andrea, Franci and Alvaro.

The buffet was the only restaurant as the other two were by reservation only and one was almost a week to get into.  We did take the trolley over the the Bavaro Palace (family side) for dinner one night (reservation only) but found that resort too large for us and prefer one that is easily accessible to get around. Our biggest difference in quality from other all inclusives we've been to in Jamaica and Punta Cana was that housekeeping kept taking the towels and face clothes but never replaced so we had to keep looking for a housekeeper to get more.  As well the drinks (beer and water) didn't get replaced and that was another search for housekeeping.  The drinks from the bars seemed weak (Margaritas, Gin/Tonic and Rum/Coke) and not as tasty as other resorts. We had a relaxing time overall though we don't think it will warrant a return visit."]},

I would say as you are reading mine please keep in mind I am very particular about my rooms and this room at this hotel was not up to my standards. My boyfriend and I first enter the lobby of the hotel. They greet us with a drink great but the front desk just had a sarcastic attitude with everything you ask them. I read that rooms won\u2019t be ready until 3PM. The front desk hands us luggage tags to bring to the bell hop. I did it and didn\u2019t think anything of it. So I said okay we will eat then come back for our room keys. We ate at the buffet (food is very subpar) DO NOT expect anything authentic in flavor ( the Mangu tastes better in NY). ", "So 3PM finally comes and we get our room keys. Usually we have someone escort us with our luggage or they come shortly. We arrive into the room with a VERY underwhelming feeling. I make the best of it but I cannot get past the fact the headboard in our room and nightstands have paint splatter! I mean it\u2019s important to pay attention to detail!! I again look passed this because we are a few steps from the beach. BUT how can I enjoy the beach if it takes an hour for our bags to be dropped off? We called twice and just waited in our rooms. Then it hit me how would they know where to drop it off if the luggage tag they handed to us before we received our room key did not have the room number? Again attention to detail. ", "The room also was very warm even with the AC and ceiling fan. Also beware there are ants and lots of mosquitos along the hot tub. ", "The staff is not as warm and friendly especially the AM staff. They don\u2019t come to the table and ask for your drink order. I had to flag them down and still they looked like I just offended them. The only way they smiled is if you tipped them. Then they catered to your hand and feet. That left a bad taste in my mouth. Also here is a tip: they do a survey during dinner in the middle of the week asking how the food, service etc is. They all come over and say \u201cYou\u2019re going to give us all excellent right\u201d \u201cLet me see\u201d \u201cOkay good\u201d. How can I be honest if this survey is NOT discreet?

We had dinner at the a la carte restaurants both at the resort and the sister restaurants  which are accessible via a shuttle.  I was very surprised that the restaurants over there (sister resort), the food was slightly of better quality and service than in Punta Cana Princess and drinks- wine- (if you have to pay for) is actually 25% cheaper! On the whole, the food experience has not been great so far- not that I am a fussy eater, as I eat anything and everything, but sometimes the food was not very palatable.  Unfortunately my partner had violently suffered from food poisoning afer we visited the Brazilian restaurant in the sister resort. (fortunately I did not have the fish and turkey).  Both the white and red wines were apaling and undrinkable- so we stuck with water most of the time.", "The entertainment team work really hard to provide entertainment during the day (on the beach and by the swimming pool) and the show at night, mostly the same people who seem to be overworked and I do have some concerns about the amount of hours they work in a week.  It is a shame that we have to purchase Wi-Fi anywhere else in the resort, given that this is a 5 star hotel- you have to absolutely come to the lobby only to get a very slow internet connection.  I was looking forward to go to a well equiped gym everyday, but I was so dissapointed that there was only a very tiny gym with barely any equipment in.", "Although the beach is great and the water luke warm and great to bathe in all day long, the hotel should have provided a better service to clean the beach daily from the debris and seaweeds; although some of the cleaning men have done some good job in bagging some seaweeds in black plastic bags with their bare hands but left them on the beach which is an eye sore- most of the left bags full if seaweeds were reclaimed back into the sea by the waves.  I came on holiday to this nice beach resort to savour the peace and quietness  of my holiday and to have a relax time.  Although it is not a problem for pedlars and other locals to sell their craft and art works on the beach, we were cornered and felt harrassed by the hotel's staff for massage constantly- even though I have declined a few times, its the same person harrassing us all the times and they dont know how to take NO for an answer- that was a total put off.", "Although the staff were very approachable, friendly and welcoming and given that the resort itself is not bad in terms of rooms and cleanliness and the service from staff is good.

We booked our vacation package with JetBlue vacations which included flights, hotel and airport transfers, this was our fourth trip to an all-inclusive resort in the Dominican and third trip booked with JetBlue.  Our round-trip flights from Boston Ma. to the Dominican were on time and uneventful, smooth\u2026.no complaints, the hotel transfer was booked thru JetBlue and provided by Travel in Style, always nice vans but it would be nice if the drivers could speak some English.  Princess All Suites is very nice smaller than most resorts, the food was okay and staff for the most part were excellent, they do however have a problem with mosquitoes and they seem to be immune to the bug repellent we brought with us. ", "   On Tuesday October 9th the day started with our usual routine breakfast then head to the pool for the day.  We left the room around 9:00 am and returned around 3:00 pm, my wife wanted something for the itch from the bug bites so I grabbed a credit card from my wallet and we went to the store at the resort, when the clerk ran the card I gave her she said it wasn\u2019t working\u2026????....it was an expired card so I ran back to the room grabbed my wallet and all my credit cards and $60.00 in cash was gone, the expired card was left behind.  We immediately went to the front desk to report that our room was robbed, we spoke with the hotel manager who escorted us back to the room with hotel security.  I was panicking a bit and I couldn\u2019t find my cell phone and thought that was stolen as well but fortunately we did find it in my luggage where I left it, at this point I could see that the hotel was assuming I was making up the story\u2026..my wallet was in my back pocket of my shorts that I had worn the night before and placed in my suitcase with the dirty clothes.  So, at some point between 9:00 am and 3:00 pm someone went in the room and rummaged thru our belongings and cleaned out my wallet, at least my wife had the sense enough to put everything else in the safe. ", "   The hotel keeps a record of who accesses the room by the door swipes, according to their records our room was accessed twice by security around 11:45 am so the room could be fumigated, we had no prior notice that the room was to be fumigated.  The room was accessed again around 12:40 pm by the maid. After contacting our credit card companies, we learned that three transactions took place from my Bank of America Visa card at 12:56 pm and 12:57pm to a KC Tours Bavaro each in the amount of $372.51.  The maid has been in the room each day prior with no issues and was cleaning the room while the credit card was being used.  The fact that one hour after the room was fumigated the credit card was used, one can only assume the security guard or the fumigator used the card.  As I learned from hotel management the guy who was fumigating the room was a sub-contractor hired by the hotel and escorted by hotel security, he had free rein to access the room.  Common sense tells me that the guard was not in the room while he was fumigating and the fumigator had the opportunity to search the room. On Wednesday the hotel manager and security escorted me to the Dominican police station so I could file a report.  On Thursday the assistant general manager Orlando Pimentel told me that according to the police department data on businesses KC Tours Bavaro did not exist.  Mr. Pimentel stated \u201cThis does not happen in this hotel\u2026your card was probably cloned and accessed in the states\u201d.  NO! I stated........how do you explain the cards are gone cash is gone and were used from a location in Bavaro?  He had no explanation to my question.  I asked Mr. Pimentel for copies of my complaint and the room access info for the bank and I was told that is privileged hotel information.  Mr Pimentel stated that he would e-mail me more info but as of October 20th I have had no contact from the hotel about this matter.  You can deny it all you want but there is a thief with access to every guest room at that resort.", "   Although the resort is very nice, the staff is great, and entertainment was very good, my wife and I could not shake the feeling that we were not safe\u2026\u2026after traveling all over the Caribbean, Europe and North America for over twenty years we have never had this feeling before.  Hotel managements attitude toward the situation was totally unacceptable so we will never return to Punta Cana Princess again or recommend the resort to anyone.  Once we were home I contacted Bank of America and was told that my Visa card was used a total of four times, three charges in Bavaro and one in Punta Cana totaled over $1,200.00 in charges, Bank of America did return the money to my account but I am still out the $60.00 dollars cash not to mention all the inconvenience that ruined our vacation.

I was yelled at multiple times for my bikini showing while I was trying to grab a snack. Someone also stole my beach towel on the beach and I was charged $20 for a new one. All in all unpleasant experience with the staff and extra charges."]},

The location is good, the accomodation great and the staff are very welcoming. The free WiFi is only available in the lobby and is very slow. This is 2018 and I would expect free WiFi in rooms with the good speed. The buffet restaurant has a good selection of food although the quality is variable. The food is always over-cooked and meat dry. Even the pancakes at breakfast are crispy and chewy as they are kept warm. We went to breakfast when the buffet opened and it was the same situation - the food had been made some time in advance. It's such a pity the pancakes weren't fresher.", "There are a number of a la carte restaurants, but with the exception of the mare nostrum seafood restaurant, are worse than the buffet. The a la carte restaurants in the sister resort are much better, especially the mexican el sombrereo restaurant. We went to the Rodrizzo Brazillian restaurant and it started well, although again a lot of the meat was dry and over-cooked. However, the turkey and fish were under-cooked. Early the next morning I wish we hadn't visited the Brazillian restaurant - I got food poisoning! This was a first for me, and not something I want to repeat. I was wiped out all day and had no energy. My stomach was upset for the remainder of our holidays. We met up with a couple who were on the adjacent table in the Brazillian and they too had the same symptoms.", "The drinks are terrible. The cheapest spirits which much be watered down. I didn't feel in the slightest bit light headed after drinking a spirit and mixer, despite the generous serving of spirits. The house wines - there is one red and one white are awful, I've never tatsed wine like it. I've tried some really cheap wine in the past which are far superior to the wine served at the PC Princess. They do have a wine list of wines to purchase, but what are we paying all-inclusive for? Incidently, the same wines in the sister resort are 25% cheaper! The cocktails are no better either. They are incredibly sweet - even the Margartita!", "The beach was great, although the seaweed was a problem. There were a couple of guys making some effort to clean it up, but they left as much as they took away. They bagged the seaweed up by hand and then left many of the black sacks on the beach all day. I even saw the waves wash some of the sacks back into the sea.", "We were constantly approached by vendors selling souvenirs, excursions, massages. They weren't a big issue. However, the Royal Holiday timeshare reps were a real issue. They hang out in the lobby and start by telling you how you can book much cheaper direct next time. They start coaching you on what to say but before we got to the hour long pressure sell we wisely left. We went for a walk on the beach and were approached by a friendly guy (who we later realised was a also a concierge for Royal Holiday) who wanted to show us this new resort (Bavaro Princess). We went along and he gave us a drive around the resort, before parking up and telling us he gets $20 if we register interest in the Royal Holiday offering. We couldn't believe we had again fallen prey to these people again. He drove us a bit further into the middle of nowehere, where he tried to extract personal details from us. At that point I asked to be taken back to the beach, but he forgot how to speak Engligh at that point and refused to take us back! I asked another member of staff to take us, but nothing was forth-coming. we asked directions from another guest and started walking back to the beach (barefoot I might add). A little while later the golf cart screached up and the concierge took us back to the beach as fast as the cart would go, whilst shouting and swearing at us constantly in Spanish all the way back to the beach. It was a really unpleasant experience, and doesn't reflect well on Princess hotels.", "Needless to say I wouldn't go back."]},

Once again they exceeded my expectations. Returning from the beach on two separate nights I found a fruit and cheese platter along with balloons on my door in the room dressed in flowers. I actually spoke to several guests who told me they had the same experience. Princess Resorts treats everybody like a special guest. Eddie love and Daniel at the front desk will be sure any special requests are provided. On this visit I was recovering from an ankle injury and they were sure to give me a room close to transportation and on the first floor. Bavaro beach is one of the most beautiful in the world and trust me I have been too many of them including beaches in Greece and Hawaii. The food was exceptional weather I was in the buffets or the specialty restaurants. Now that I have been there several times another great aspect of the princess location is there Central in the beach where you can walk in either direction for about a mile. You can get easily to either sections of local specialty shops that are on the beach. Getting a real flavor of Punta Cana and their wonderful people. Not that I spent a lot of time in the room but all rooms have Jacuzzis comfortable beds all the amenities cleaned daily. Although not necessary I always recommend a small tip with the service you receive at these resorts. That small amount goes a long way for the locals and they really appreciate it.

They had provided a very nice fruit plate, as well as a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  They gave us a couple ballcaps (which I highly recommend having in that sun, LOL).  We were also offered a private dinner on the beach as a compensation for the night before's mess up.  OMG, my wife and I LOVED it.   I HIGHLY recommend it - they set up a romantic little tent on the beach, and we had the coolest waiter in the world named Sterling; a young man who apparently loves his job and the people he attends.  The dinner and the experience was just top notch.  The steak that my wife had was fantastic, as were the four lobster tails that came on my plate.  WELL DONE!!  Throughout the rest of our stay, everything was on point.  Marino at the lobby bar, Annahi (spelling phoenetically) and Alexandria at the pool side, and Margarita at the towel exchange were all superb.

Elise was assigned to our group as our personal hostess for our stay and she was great! She checked in on us daily and also sent us texts with what was happening on the resort daily. Elise deserves a 10-star rating but since we were not satisfied with the resort overall we\u2019re giving an overall 2 star rating. The alcohol, the food, the staff, and the resort as a whole were all subpar. Most of the staff we encountered were not very pleasant. Although along with Elise, our group really enjoyed Victor and Fernando at the Strip Grill. These guys deserve some major recognition. At one point every restaurant on the resort was closed with the exception of one and the food there was not good at all. This occurred daily between 5 and 6:30. Once we were enjoying the pool and were told that the pool bar had just closed and was only serving beer and water. It was only 6 PM. Each time we ordered premium liquor (Patron, Crown, or even Jack Daniel\u2019s which with the Exhale service upgrade we should have had access to) we\u2019d get something else. Yet the staff were pouring it out of a Patron, Crown Royal, or Jack Daniel\u2019s bottle. The actual room smelled of mildew and the sheets/pillows each day had a moist/ sticky feeling making it very hard for us to enjoy a good night\u2019s rest.

If that\u2019s your thing great but if you don\u2019t like it\u2019s hard to avoid.   Xhale club is the escape from all the busy.  A really nice relaxing pool steps away from the beach. Attentive service.  Limited guests so no fighting for drinks or loungers.  Separate area on the beach is clutch.   2). Geographically speaking, xhale is steps from the beach and has a really nice, calm, pool with a private bar and lounge.   3) jean Carlos.  He is a \u201chost\u201d. Every xhale me never gets a host. You just text him anything you need, big or small, and he takes care of it.  That is a really nice service.  As he says \u201cleave it in my hands\u201d.  I did, and he did a great job.

We were in Building 5 which is quite the walk to the hotel lobby but I guess it's good exercise since you're lounging around all day :).

The bathroom was not very clean (urine on the toilets that I had to clean myself) greasy stains on the glass orange doors, hairs in the shower. On the next days, the cleaning will be far better but will vary a lot! Never the same service and either a lack of formation, or a lack of good will.", "Room service the first night was way too long (15 minutes to manage to reach them, not picking up the phone or asking you to wait to never take the call back, then, 1.5 hour to be delivered for 1 cesar salad, 1 pizza and 1 nacho plate), the meals were bad quality (Cesar salad must be with grilled bread, not old dried bread, industrial pizza and oily nachos). I found a fish bone in my chicken Cesar salad. What about hygiene?", "On the second day, we had the very unpleasant surprise to find our safe open when back from the pool. I remembered perfectly having checked that it was closed, as I always do when I leave my room. Some money disappeared but my other valuables and phones were untouched. I had to cancel my credit card for security reasons. The hotel staff with security came to check my room and made a report about it. It made us pass the rest of our stay in a very stressful and insecure position. Reading other comments on trip advisor made me realize that it also happened before! I just want you to know that if you have cash, you have better put it in your luggage and lock it because safe is not a good option there! They are trying very hard to avoid that kind of situation and hopefully, it will end soon!", "The Concierge team managed by Jose and Daniel really reacted on a very professional manner to our issue. It was very sad to see how the other departments in the hotel are not managed the same way. (I had to call the drivers to go to a romantic dinner on the beach, as the concierge requested me to do so, the guy answered me I could walk! I asked him where the meeting point was and he told me \"you should know\", sorry, I did not know!) (On our last day, the concierge told us he would provide us a champagne bottle in our beach cabana but when we asked the waiter and cabana manager, they refused and said they do not bring champagne bottles on the beach).", "Entertainment team was nice but some of them were fighting and arguing together in front of us, which made us very uncomfortable.

I just do not like how they use wild animals to make money (Aras, monkey, iguana).", "For shopping, the hotel arcades are very nice.

We have been tipping each time but probably not enough as they could even take our empty glasses to never ask us if we wanted something else. They could also, after we ordered at the same time as the next seat couple, serve the other couple but not us. So we ended going to the bar on our own. Unlimited luxury?", "Be prepared to fight for a seat as most people reserve their spot everywhere with towels for sometimes never showing. I even saw a woman reserving the spots in front of her cabana just to be sure to have the view for herself! We took the liberty to remove towels when we saw them!", "Also, it is a shame that nobody makes the guests respect one another by not playing loud individual music on portative speakers. I think the waiters should do so. Sincerely guys, do you really think everybody will love and would like to hear your sound?", "I thought the music would be too much for us and I was right. It is never ending and when you find a peaceful spot, somebody comes and play his own music!

If the air conditioning was not freezing us, it would have been perfect!", "I was very disappointed by the drinks and particularly the cocktails which were made with over-sugarry prepared mixes. Not good at all! Impossible, for example, to have a moscow mule or even a mojito with mint leafs. Real cocktails are very important, otherwise, it makes them cheap and disgusting.

No separation, nothing. And people there are paying less than you but they just enjoy same restaurants, bars, pool, beach... the only thing different is their rooms!

The rooms also really need some updating, the shower was rusty and the room was not fully clean, I had to clean the shower head (as not all the water was coming through, due to it not being cleaned) and coffee machine when we got there. From a 5* hotel we just did not expect this, especially when it was SO quiet. ", "The entertainment was awful apart from one night where they did a Michael jackson tribute and the dancer was amazing.

They generally made us both feel very uncomfortable.", "The hotel allows venders on site, a mini shop by the pool and a pop up shop sometimes in the evening.

There was also a hotel shop, I had to buy tampons whilst we were there, i'm sorry but where do they get the price of $27 from?! Also someone else wrote about mosquitos, we bought some very expensive spray from the hotel shop ($30) and we both still go lots of bites (I had 15 on one leg), I think it may have been in the hotel rooms.", "On a positive note, the bar and restaurant staff were very friendly and we thought the food was amazing. The hotel grounds are gorgeous and very well kept, however the pool is quite dirty. We also went on a few excursions with the sea pro team attached to the hotel which were amazing!", "All in all, in our opinion, this is not a 5* resort and is way overpriced for what it is.

Yes, the shower may drain slowly and onto the bathroom floor, but not enough to really complain about.  They are always cleaning up and maintaining the grounds.  Yes, they only have Presidente beer...you're in the Dominican Republic...we were upgraded to the VIP status and if you have to pay for it, there's not much benefit really.  We only ate at the Steakhouse as far as the a la carte dining goes and they had a mariachi playing from table to table and this place is small so there was no way you were going to have a conversation.

Don't talk to them, don't shake their hand, don't go close to them.  The photo guys on the beach with the monkeys, iguanas and parrots were even worse.  Again, same threats will work for the remainder of your stay.  And yes, yes I know, they are poor, they work hard, they work on tips...but no is still no and ask any of the staff how well we tip.

This was our 2nd AM Resort. On vacation we like to relax but also like to be social and take part in entertainment, and parties. I\u2019ll break my review down into categories to make it an easier read because this is going to be a long one.", "Check In/Out & Xhale: We booked this trip through Apple Vacations, and arrived to the resort on a Sunday. Upon our arrival at about 12:30 (check in is at 3:00) we were told that we had been upgraded to Xhale for free. I was excited because I had read great reviews about the experience and was curious what having a \u201cpersonal concierge\u201d would be like. We hopped on the golf cart and were dropped at the Xhale lounge with 4 other couples. The two Check In desks were occupied so we were told to grab a seat and a drink and that they\u2019d be with us shortly. Instead of calling each couple up to the desk when they were finished with the previous guests, they had about a few employees running around to us, and everyone else that had arrived, trying to collect passports and paperwork to start the check in process. In my opinion this was not efficient at all and took about 20 minutes. We were given room keys, but not a room number and were told that our room wasn\u2019t ready, but to grab lunch and come back after we finished, and maybe it\u2019d be ready then. It wasn\u2019t 3pm yet so I wasn\u2019t surprised our room wasn\u2019t ready. We were directed to \u201cThe Strip\u201d Steakhouse which was the exclusive Xhale lunch spot. After our meal, as instructed, we went back to the Xhale lounge to see if our room was ready yet. It took a few minutes for anyone to acknowledge us, again the two Check In desks were full and there were multiple employees running around helping others. We were finally asked what our room number was to see if it was ready, but I was never given a room number so I handed them the keys we were given. They said the room wasn\u2019t ready, again I understand this, just not sure why we would have been told to come back so quickly though. I kindly asked that we were brought our bags so we could put on our swimsuits to begin our vacation. I honestly didn\u2019t think this would be a big deal, but it was. I has assumed our bags would have been brought to a \u201cback room\u201d near the Xhale lounge, and they easily could grab them in a matter of minutes. Well, it took 30 minutes to get our bags delivered, they must hold them at the lobby. My husband was getting very agitated at the wait, but I couldn\u2019t tell them \u201cnever mind\u201d because I couldn\u2019t get anyone to make eye contact with me. *Pack your swimwear & sunscreen in your \u201ccarry on\u201d if you plan to arrive to the resort prior to 3, lesson learned!* By now it was 2pm so we went to the main pool. A little after 3pm we made a third trip to the Xhale lounge to get our room. Again the desks were full as was most of the other seating so I stood near the front desks until someone acknowledged me. I again was asked for my room number, which I was never given. They took our keys and told us that our room #4228 was ready! I man named Carlos escorted us to our rooms. I wasn\u2019t really sure what his job was at the time, and I\u2019m still not really sure, he wasn\u2019t dressed like the check in workers, or a bell men. After having to wait around some more in the Xhale lounge my husband and I were both irritated so we didn\u2019t say much to Carlos. We tipped him for carrying our bags and he left. Looking back I think Carlos may have been our \u201cpersonal concierge.\u201d We saw him from a far two other times on our trip but never had any other interaction with him. ", "I did a lot of reading prior to the trip so I knew Xhale wasn\u2019t something we\u2019d utilize enough to make the cost worth it to us. The private pool was small and way to quiet for us. The lounge had a bar with upgraded beverages but was out of the way. The lounge also had finger food all day but nothing that was worth snagging in my opinion. The private beach area was nice, but again to quiet for our liking. We aren\u2019t needy people so a \u201cpersonal concierge\u201d would have only been used to make reservations for \u201cSilk City\u201d the Hibachi dinner. We did eat at the exclusive Xhale lunch spot twice throughout our trip, which was nice because the lunch selections were limited, more on that later. I don\u2019t know if we didn\u2019t get a \u201cpersonal concierge\u201d because we didn\u2019t pay for Xhale or if Carlos was ours and just didn\u2019t want to deal with us because we were grumpy during our first and only encounter. Either way we didn\u2019t pay for Xhale, we didn\u2019t really use Xhale, and I\u2019d never pay for Xhale if I returned. ", "Check out was similar to check in, the desks were busy, I stood there aimlessly, and it took a while to get acknowledged. I think they need to figure out a better system for Xhale Check In & Out.  They should add at least two more desks and someone in charge of either handing out \u201cnumbers\u201d or tracking who was next to be helped is. It\u2019s very confusing because not everyone in the lounge needs to Check In or Out, some people are just sitting there to relax. The whole thing boggled my mind. That being said this was the worst part of our trip and everything else was up from there! Moving on to positive vibes\u2026..", "Room- As mentioned our \u201cupgraded\u201d room was #4228 (building 4, 2nd floor). This was a partial ocean view room, and partial was generous. Again we weren\u2019t expecting a view at all, but if we had paid for one I might have been disappointed. The room was well kept by housekeeping. They stopped in twice a day, to make the beds, and stock fresh towels. The mini bar was always stocked and was perfect for our needs. The AC was a bit confusing but I quickly learned to just not touch and it, and it worked fine. A few small things that people have mentioned and that are true. The tile floors are never really \u201cclean.\u201d If you walk around barefoot you will get sand on your feet, but I think that should be expected being at the beach. The second thing was the dampness of the room. Yes this is true, even when I unpacked our clothes at home to wash them they were all damp. The sheets in the room were also damp feeling. But again, you\u2019re in a humid climate so this should be expected. The final thing was Jacuzzi on the balcony, yes it was a little dirty. It is outside and nature happens. I\u2019d much rather have housekeeping keeping my toilet and shower clean then spending their time cleaning the Jacuzzi anyways. Overall the room was sufficient. There was nothing stand out about it and nothing that would deter me from returning or recommending it.", "Restaurants- We stayed at Breathless for 7 nights, and were able to try 5 of the ala carte dinner options, most of the lunch options, and the breakfast buffet. We also were invited to the Apple Vacations dinner. On our trip \u201cSofrito\u201d Latin Restaurant was only open one night (we missed it) and Kibbeh wasn\u2019t open at all, it was utilized as seating for the dinner buffet from \u201cSpoon.\u201d We also missed eating at \u201cCulinaria\u201d International Restaurant because the menu didn\u2019t appeal to us. We generally ate dinner around 7:30pm, Sunday-Thursday we got right into any restaurant we wanted but Friday & Saturday we had waits; I assume that\u2019s just because the resorts capacity increased for the weekend. The waits were never more than 20 minutes and that time was easily be passed with a drink or two.", "Dinner: \u201cCoquette\u201d French Restaurant- This was my husband\u2019s favorite. He had both the duck & lamb, which he enjoyed both. And I had the chicken, it was average. I also had the chocolate dessert which was the only dessert at the entire resort that I enjoyed and finished. The ambiance of this place was my favorite. There was a bar inside the restaurant, there was a man playing the violin (I think, my memory is escaping me) and the restaurant was dimly lit. It felt romantic. The other restaurants were dimly lit but none felt romantic.", "\u201cPicante\u201d Mexican Restaurant- This was my favorite restaurant. I had the chicken fajitas as my main course and it was tasty. I can\u2019t remember what my husband had but I remember him saying it was really spicy. The food here was defiantly very flavorful and heavily spiced.", "\u201cSilk City\u201d Hibachi Restaurant- The only other all-inclusive hibachi experience I\u2019ve had was at Secrets in Montego Bay where we had an amazing time as the waiters did tricks and sang songs the whole time. This also being an AM resort I had high hopes, and was a bit let down. The hibachi show was 10 seconds of fire and that\u2019s about it. There was some fancy spatula work but nothing compared to Secrets or what I\u2019m used to seeing in the states. On the flip side the food was very tasty and we left full and happy.", "\u201cSpumante\u201d Italian Restaurant- I don\u2019t really have too much to say about this one. I had a spicy pasta dish and my husband couldn\u2019t decide between the shrimp pasta & shrimp risotto so they brought both (I think he liked the risotto better). The food was good not great.", "\u201cThe Strip\u201d Steak House- We had the biggest laugh at this restaurant because we felt like it had an identity crisis. They brought nachos to the table for all tables as an appetizer, and on the appetizer menu there was mozzarella sticks (I got them and they were great), but the restaurant was advertised as a steak house. I got the fillet and I can\u2019t remember what my husband got. Every entr\u00e9e was served with the same sides, just a different cut of beef. The meal was good just a bit comical. Leaving there we had wished they would have let you order one or two sides of your choice, like a more upscale steakhouse in the states.", "Apple Vacations Dinner- This was held at Croquette which was nice, again the ambiance get 5 stars from me. It was a set menu of surf and turf. The food was good and the service was very attentive. Something to note if you booked through Apple, they are a #1 partner with Breathless so they try to do small things to make you VIP, hence the Xhale upgrade. They also put an Apple (yes a piece of fruit) on your table each night at dinner to let your waiters know you\u2019ve booked through Apple. I don\u2019t think this really affected the service but I did notice that each night they\u2019d bring out a \u201cspecial\u201d dish to only people with Apples on their table. Honestly I wasn\u2019t a fan of this, we normally didn\u2019t touch it and it became wasteful.", "Lunch: \u201cBarefoot Grill\u201d Beachside Restaurant- I really didn\u2019t care for the way this restaurant was set up. It was kind of an open air kiosk. There were four sides all with different food you could either order or grab and go. The first time I walked up a left because I couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. I wish there was more menu signage and clear lines for each food item offered. They had salads, pizza, burgers, and this taco type thing. A couple days we grabbed a slice of piece pizza but that was about it from there.", "\u201cThe Strip\u201d Xhale Exclusive Restaurant- We really enjoyed this option. I had the stir fry twice and enjoyed it both times. My husband tried the chicken burrito and the stir fry and also enjoyed it. The service here was very fast. In addition to this restaurant you have access to the lunch buffet that\u2019s attached. I peaked in there once but didn\u2019t find anything that struck me as exciting. The buffet is open to everyone during lunch.", "Food Cart Poolside at the Freestyle Pool- I hate to say it but this was our favorite lunch option at the resort. We had tacos & nachos here twice and burgers here once (they rotate each day). The food was made to order and very tasty. The Freestyle Pool is far from the other lunch options so it\u2019s a very pleasant addition.", "Breakfast: \u201cSpoon\u201d Buffet- I love a good breakfast buffet and this one was great. My husband had an omelet made to order daily, they were super quick and there was never a line. I really enjoyed the variety of fresh fruit and fruit juices. Not a single complaint to be made here.", "\u201cThe Nook Caf\u00e9\u201d Coffee Shop- Cute little addition. There was a couple days were we couldn\u2019t handle a full breakfast so we grabbed our warm beverages, fresh fruit salad, and pastries. They had some grab and go sandwiches which we never tried as well as ice cream in the afternoons. I tried the ice cream once and it was okay. My mom owes an ice cream shop so I\u2019m a bit spoiled when it comes to ice cream. It did the trick that day but I wouldn\u2019t go back for seconds.", "Bars: (I apologize when it comes to pool side bars I don\u2019t know which one is which so I labeled them by the pool names)", "Main Pool Swim Up & Walk Up- We didn\u2019t really utilize this bar too much, but I really liked that they had a self-serve soft drink machine. This was the only one of its kind and I appreciated that you could get ice from it. Both of the pool bars had self-serve spa water but being able to put it over ice without having to ask was great!", "Freestyle Pool Swim Up & Walk Up- We spent most of our time here. The bartenders there really know how to hustle! People are ordering rounds of 10 shots at a time and they pump them out, without blinking an eye. You never have to wait very long. We were always served with a smile.", "Roaming Beach & Pool Servers- I struggled with the language barrier with a few of the servers. They were always friendly but the communication struggle is something to note. A standout would be Andrew at the Freestyle Pool. He became our go to guy, and remembered us by name.", "\u201cWink\u201d Lobby Bar- We used this bar whenever the pop up bar near the show stage was packed. These guys always pump it out in the evenings when the entertainment it at its full peak. Again never had to wait long and was always served with a smile.", "\u201cAfter Dark\u201d Night Club Bar- We stopped by this bar a couple of nights. Again there was some language barrier with a couple of the bartenders but in the end it was fine.", "Freestyle Pool & Pool Parties: We were at this pool most days for the afternoon party. The Foam Party was the stand out, but I have to say it got a little rowdy. There were blow up dolls being passed around, and intentional bath suits mishaps. Would not recommend for the uptight and faint of heart. Also enjoyed the entertainment at the champagne spray party. The violinist was very talented and I enjoyed watching the guys breakdance.", "Evening Shows: As the week went on the entertainment got better and better. We made it to most of the shows. There were a few that didn\u2019t leave an impression and you could tell the dancers weren\u2019t impressed either. The standouts were the Circus Show and The Gatsby Show. The Circus show was held in the outdoor stage space near the lobby. I could watch the aerial artists and fire performers all day. I really like how they performed on the ground because it seemed more intimate and in your face. The Gatsby Show was great as well, you could really tell the performers enjoyed putting on this show. And the fireworks were an awesome addition!", "Water Sports: We decided to paddle board one afternoon. There was no wait which was nice. But the employees working the stand weren\u2019t very friendly. I kind of expected the guys to ask if we needed any assistance but they gave us our equipment and set us free. I unintentionally drifted into the reef and they one gentleman was yelling at me. I am a 5\u20193\u201d women with minimal upper body strength. I knew not to hit the coral with my paddle but obviously I couldn\u2019t communicate that to him out in the water. Once we came to shore I apologized but the guy didn\u2019t speak to us at all. It was uncomfortable to say the least.", "All and all I would 100% recommend this resort and would consider coming back. The grounds & beach were beyond beautiful! Public areas were constantly being cleaned, even the poolside restrooms. I\u2019d really like to try some on the other Breathless locations to compare."]},

We have never had anything like this happen in the past at any of the many resorts we vacation at in Dominican Republic. The level of service that we received when our room was not correct is unacceptable in our opinion. We have stayed at other Melia properties in the past and never had an issue like this.

The stench that came out of the filthy and unkept sink in my room that was bad enough to knock a horse off its feet or the poor communication which existed between staff members? Either way, from the bottom up, things may seem fine but when it comes to the \u201cbig dogs\u201d and leaders of the pack, they were a disappointment in every way.  In fact, every problem and decision had to go through management making it impossible to reach them or to come to a resolution. The place is run like an advertisement magazine reaching its long claws out to get you until you are so bothered by the persistent staff and marketing of products that you cave and end up spending more money on an already expensive vacation. There was no respect between staff and guests. Even when voicing our concerns about the conditions of the room and the ways in which the hotel is run and how it is not practical for guests who have come to relax and enjoy their stay, you are pushed aside like garbage and told the resolution will have to come from management, only to find out that everyone is giving you the run around and a resolution was never offered. I was told to put in a formal complaint. That was it. No accommodations, no making sure the guests were happy, and no FORMAL APOLOGY! The place is definitely not worth the money. It\u2019s true that the entertainment personnel and wait staff try to make you have a good time, however, when there are so many cracks in the foundation, those things come second to cleanliness, health, and safety. I also had an emergency one morning and was unable to reach a person at the front desk for one hour! So unacceptable! Do not stay here.

The resort grounds were beautiful and well manicured.  Our 2 ground floor rooms had 2 twin beds for 4 women which worked out well.  We were in bldg #5 which seemed to be the best location to everything.  We loved the pool area and that the hotel was adults only.   We thought the food was ok--really enjoyed the fondue and took advantage of going to the neighboring Caribe resort, Brazillian restaurant, Radizzio which was wonderful!  Unfortunately, you never know which restaurant is going to be open each night and when you ask the front desk they tell you one thing and then that is not what happened!  The Italian restaurant was good too!   We also took advantage of the spa--the massages were wonderful!!    ", "We had read before our trip all of the reviews about the beach seagrass and thought  we could overcome it--NOT so much.  It was so disconcerting to watch the grounds men trying to rake up by hand (back-breaking) the knee deep seaweed each day not making much headway because it was coming in faster than they could rake--after a couple of days they used a tractor to haul it into a big pile which sat 2 days and stunk horrendously--then they took it by dump truck out.  This is not their fault (it was in the water all around the island), but it definitely hampered our beach time.  We just did excursions instead--we learned to scuba dive through Jeff/SeaPro team in the pool and then went out to Catalina island to snorkel and scuba --it was BEAUTIFUL there!!!  Unfortunately, they didn't tell us the drive there and back would take THREE long hours EACH WAY (we were the first and last of many hotels to pick up and drop off folks). ", "  What made this trip exceptional for us was the wonderful staff!  From the Front desk -Carmen, security Agapito (who really helped us our first night there), the bar team--Jose, Luis, Frederick and especially Glenys and Louisa who ensured we never had an empty drink and made special drinks for us each day, restaurant staff especially the most pleasant man ever-Jaime, and then the animation crew Jose (Vamanos), Juan Carlos better know as Chokolade and Almondo--they made the afternoons fun--but the disco night in the rain was our favorite-not a dry person on the dance floor!

People are very friendly and some are aggressive (when it come to making their money... can\u2019t be mad at them for that but when you are relaxing, it can be a little overwhelming at times) They offer fun excursions that everyone should consider! The one thing that I wish was different was that the beach didn\u2019t have as much moss as it did. Made it unpleasant to walk and dip in the beach... but Overall I would recommend this place For first travelers (adults only) just to see what it\u2019s like! No regrets!

The first looks of things it looks great.  ", "The check in process was ok. Everyone was very friendly happy and helpful even a refreshing welcome drinks and cool towels. Even though our booking was called \u201cPremium\u201d they told us it isn\u2019t the upgrade to the ocean view and the extras. So my friend had to negotiate for what we were expecting. ", "We were given a ride to building 5 along with our luggage and Jose was wonderful and carried all of our luggage to our room. ", "We were very disappointed that there wasn\u2019t any type of dresser or chest of drawers to put our clothes in. Only shelves in the closet. ", "The TV only had a few channels that was a fuzzy mess and a static sound along with a popping noise.  For what we had paid to upgrade everything should work perfectly. Balcony was great but the neighbors to the left were very close. The balcony furniture was very basic and not comfortable. We learned to use the pillows from the couch as some cushion. The AC seemed to kick off around 5:30 or 6:00pm and the room would get pretty stuffy. We just thought that this was normal. Our first meal was disappointing we ate at the steakhouse/Tex-Mex. the steaks were so tough and grissley we both just gave up fighting with them along with the rest of the restaurant. ", "Unfortunately the beach was being inundated by the sea grass/ sea weed / algae and the resort was using local men to carry it out one black trash bag at a time. This we both knew was a lost cause since it was washing up on the beach knee deep with nearly every wave. The Bali beds were nice but several were missing their shade covers. And they are supposed to be for the upgraded guests but everyone were using them. We didn\u2019t use the palapa area so not able to give a review on them. ", "The drinks were very good the first 4-5 days and they didn\u2019t spare the alcohol by no means. But after about 5 days they started to have a lingering after taste. My friend drinks Dr Pepper and I drink Diet Coke. They don\u2019t have Dr Pepper at all and they said they were giving me Diet Coke or Lite Coke but I don\u2019t think it was. Breakfast buffet was very good and has lots of choices. They had BBQ for lunch on Wednesdays and Sundays that was outstanding. The rest of our lunches we ate at Mare Nostrum we ate out at the bar area for the view of the ocean. It was food nothing to write home about. We had upgraded and went over to eat at La Cava for our meal at a restaurant that isn\u2019t included in the all inclusive package it was very very good. We both gave the Swiss restaurant to giant thumbs DOWN!! Yucky!!! We were always able to find something to fill our stomachs at the buffet. But again it was food nothing to write home about. We tried the steakhouse a second time and this time the food was edible and good. We were never able to catch Mare Nostrum open for supper. They need to have a schedule of what nights each of the restaurants are open and their menus in the rooms. They give you a paper with the hours they are open but nothing about what nights they are open. ", "Since the beach was so full of the ugly sea grass and a very stinky mess we spent most of our time at the pool. It is great and there is a island with coconut palms so you could be in the shade if you wanted some shade. Pool bar was nice and the bartender was very attentive. The entertainment team was very fun the first 4-5 days after that they were doing the same things everyday. And when they did do the dance lesson the main guy insulted and embarrassed a lady so badly about her not quite getting the hang of the dance OVER THE MICROPHONE so we ALL heard him she quit and left the group. I ask you if we are paying good money at a nice RESORT is that acceptable? Also he was so hard to understand we mostly couldn\u2019t tell what he was talking about and when we did try to ask him a question about what he was announcing he seemed to purposely not even try to understand our questions. So we quit even thinking about participating. The evening entertainment if you could call it that the first few nights they actually did a little show and dance. After that they did contests what\u2019s worse it was couple contests. PEOPLE not everyone that are at an adult only property are couples. So we quit attending the evening events. ", "They weren\u2019t ever able to fix our TV so they finally moved us 5 days into our stay they moved us to a room with a working TV. That\u2019s when we found out that the AC in the other room didn\u2019t work right either. We had a better view in this room. ", "There isn\u2019t much room in the bathroom for toiletries. ", "We booked our one and only excursion through the water sports guys. And we were told one thing and it wasn\u2019t what we were told. ", "The rooms were clean and we did have to call for washcloths more than once during our stay. The towel exchange for the \u201cupgraded\u201d people was not very organized. ", "They did mosquito fog several times but with NO WARNING when they were going to do it so if you happened to be sitting on your balcony you had to grab your drinks and run for the room. Your warning was a giant fog coming around the corner at end of the building and a loud noise. ", "Guest services didn\u2019t want to help us call to check on our airport shuttle, he finally did call, but we were not satisfied with what we were told. Alexander didn\u2019t even try to get the lady at the shuttle service to understand what we wanted, that his guests wanted to be picked up at 12:00 and not 1:00. We will not be returning.

On the other hand, the rooms (at least the ones we stayed in) are more reminiscent of a 2 star motel.  Despite (weak) attempts to keep the rooms looking new, they really show their age.  Detailed reviews of different aspects below:", "Grounds - 4.5/5.  Large, beautiful looking property with an abundance of trees and beautiful landscaping.  Always groundskeepers out and about cleaning / painting / trimming, etc.", "Rooms - 2/5.  We had two rooms.  First room was a disaster.  Lights were broken, couch was missing a cushion, sink was clogged, reading light was broken, and sliding door did not lock (room 1132).  We requested a different room because of the latter.  New room we were in (1154) was slightly better, but still very dated.  See pictures. The only thing to keep in mind is that if you have little children (i.e. 1 - 2 years) running around, the rooms have two steps which separate the sleeping from the sitting areas and are a safety hazard.", "Food - 3/5.  Buffets were average with very limited selection.  There are basically two small buffets that have little variety.  Quality was ok - not great but not poor.  Most of the specialty restaurants (Fuego, The Grill, Mole, Aqua) were mediocre to average at best.  I could barely chew one of the ribs at the Grill because it was so tough.  Vento (Mediterranean) was hands down the best food experience we had there.  5/5 for Vento.", "Service - 3/5.  Decent service, staff were mostly quite friendly.  However, service at the specialty restaurants was usually slow.  At the buffet, it was often difficult to get basic things like water (I'm amazed that water is not the first thing that is offered when you sit down - we usually had to follow-up with servers several times for water as if they were intentionally trying to ration it!  Didn't understand).  Did not receive any drink service on the beach.", "Beach - 4/5.  Great big area, nice sand, lots of loungers.  Only negative was that the waves were usually very strong, so not great if you wanted calm waters to swim.", "Activities - 4/5.  Not a ton of things to do during the day if you're an adult, but the pool area is very nice and usually not crowded.  We have a small child so the redeeming factor for us was the kidszone area and kids pool.  Both were great and offer kids lots to do.  They also offer babysitting service.", "Other comments:  Didn't like the upcharge for certain drinks like Corona (US$4), staff walking around the grounds were always trying to sell photography packages, other than buffet and restaurants, there really aren't any other areas to grab food.  Since the buffet is at the back of the resort, it would be nice to have food options if you are hanging out by the front of the resort by the lobby / kidszone.", "Overall: Nice resort overall, but for the money (and alleged 5 star rating) I would not go back because of the quality of the rooms and food."]},

Main pool is much better, with the loud drunks staying close to the swim up bar. Stay back and you can enjoy the rest of the pool with ample floating mats and good drink service from the waiters. The Ocean and beach seem to have enough loungers, shade is what everyone searches for. The water is a bit cool, being the Atlantic, but ok once you're in. Seaweed is a problem like all beaches in the Caribbean, but they rake the beach constantly and it's spotty in the water. Beware, there does seem to be a strong undertow there, the water gets deep really fast and  tries dragging you out. For a party place, night time entertainment is non-existent. You will get the same dancing shows each night with slight changes, but basically the same. If you get there and can't find a seat, just wait it out, people start leaving 30 minutes into the show and seats will open up. I guess it's their \"party anthem\" but you will hear an annoying  high bass instrumental over and over, day after day which has a high pitch horn blowing in it that will test your sanity and decrease your life expectancy. The shows last until 11:00  or earlier, after that the night life is pretty much over. The rooftop  sports bar, slash, nightclub is a joke. There is ZERO indication of a sports bar inside, ZERO. It is a empty echo chamber with a bar, a few lounge sofas and a dancing pole. I never saw more than ten people in there, so loud your hair vibrates in there. Outside is a terrace that over looks the stage area with plenty of seating and great view of stage ....go up there to enjoy the view or to relax.  That's it for entertainment, pools, ocean, or poor shows. NOTHING more. No little one, two or three person bands playing in the lobby, nobody singing. Absolutely nothing during the day or evening. I guess that's why they push the excursions so hard. Not to mention the \"AM Resorts Loyalty Program\" that is constantly pushed along with vendors throughout the resort selling trinkets or cigars. We had a swim up room which was clean and comfortable. Fridge was restocked 5 out of 6 days, had to ask for towels once and safe broke once. I guess we'll call that a win !   Now the food. Not all restaurants are open every day, We ate at the \"Strip\" a grill type sit down restaurant. Appetizers were very good, (chick. wings & mozz. sticks) We both ordered the rib eye steak that came with fries, baked potato, grilled veggies, corn and coleslaw. Steak was very fatty, sides were good, coleslaw never came. The rest of the time we ate in the Buffet. There is LOTS of different food there, with  vegetables being the most plentiful. Always a few different meats, chicken beef, and pork. Sushi and fish also in abundance. Lots of fruits and deserts galore, although they look amazing, not much flavor in the deserts. Being an International resort with visitors from many different countries, you have to expect different and strange dishes you may not recognize. That being said, you should be able to find enough to eat that  is to your liking, we did, and overall were  happy  with the food. Barefoot Grill between main pool and beach has burgers, hot dogs,  salads and nachos ..etc..nice quick poolside lunch. Also, there is a buffet next door at the Onyx that is easy to get to and has slightly different items, it's near the Xhale Club & Pool. Waiters, housekeeping and grounds workers  work very hard and long and it shows in the service and beauty of this resort. Bartenders on the other hand tend to have attitudes and are not as welcoming as the rest of the staff. In a nutshell, Breathless is a beautiful resort with dedicated workers and horrible entertainment and activities. If you are staying for three days, this resort should work for you, if staying longer you may be disappointed. Maybe management should stay at a Palladium or Barcelo Resort and take notes."]},

We had a great time and would definitely go there again.  Here is my review of our experience.  ", "Travel from airport and check in:", "I always book our trips through Apple Vacations and transfers are included with Amstar.  We were greeted by an airport worker with a cart who waited with us at baggage claim to get our bags and then through some magic, he took us all the way around the long line and customs and straight out to greet our transportation company.  There were several of us going to Breathless from our plane so eight of us jumped in a small van and we were on our way, no pit stops at any other resorts.  The drive from the airport was about 45 minutes.  We packed small bottles in our luggage (crown apple for me and Woodford for my husband) from home and our Yeti cups, so we were on our way early with the cocktails on the way to the resort.    ", "We were Xhale Club so check in was smooth, they took our luggage right off the shuttle and whisked it away, make sure you keep your carryon luggage with anything you need right away with you, it did take a while for the luggage to get to the room.  They took us on a golf cart to the Xhale lounge where they let us eat some snacks, get some drinks and lounge in the AC club while they got us all checked in to our room.  They took us right to our room and our coordinator knocked on our door right after, Luis was fantastic and helped us throughout the week with anything we needed.  ", "Room", "We had a King Xhale Club partial ocean view and it was fantastic.  Spacious, nice balcony, and great view of the ocean, also overlooking the Xhale Club and Xhale pool.  Ordered room service a couple of times and it was always good and hot.  Housekeeping did a great job each day keeping the room clean and the fridge was always stocked each day.  We did pack two Damp Rids and they were both about \u00bc of the way full when we left.  Be careful if you leave the balcony door open, the floor got really slippery because of all the humidity.  It did smell a little damp in our room, but leaving the door open for a little while and using the incense helped.  ", "Pools", "Enjoyed lounging by and in all the pools.  We didn\u2019t have any trouble getting lounge chairs when we wanted one.  Swim up bar in the party pool was always a good time.  Great service for drinks by the pool (and everywhere).", "Beach", "We spent most mornings and lunch time at the beach, never an issue getting a lounge chair and the food on the beach was great, with a lot of options, including salad in a cooler if you don\u2019t want a burger/chicken/etc.   Great service on the beach all day, never an empty cup.  Had a cabana one day and that was great as well, top deck, bed, loungers and same concierge level service, all magnifico!  The water there is also great, no large waves, can snorkel right off the beach and can keep your toes in the sand if you want to stay away from the rock formations. The sand was so soft and only hot a few times.  We also walked down the beach to Tropical Treasures for massages (about a 5-10 min walk), the ladies there did a great job, would highly recommend it, $40 for an hour. The vendors do try to sell you items, but they leave you alone if you say no thank you.  ", "Food & Drinks", "The food was great, we even had the Strip make us some Dominican food one night to get more immersed in their culture.  Everything was delicious.  All the drinks were good as well.  A few times I didn\u2019t get what I ordered, I imagine that happens from time to time given how many drinks they make in a day!  ", "Activities", "We enjoyed the night activities, performances, dancing, live music, DJ and some time at the Casino.  Definitely some live parties going on Friday and Saturday nights by the Wink Bar and then on to the disco until 3 am!

The staff was not that nice and even when you tip (which we did every time), it is as if you are bothering them when you ask for something. The language barrier is really hard....and for a resort that welcomes tourists, it seemed that those of us who lack the Spanish language are pushed to the side. Please do not listen to everyone saying the food is good.....it was TERRIBLE! The food was at best BELOW average. AND the main dining was not even air conditioned where everyone, including the staff, were sweating! The only DECENT food was the fondue restaurant and they were the only ones with nice staff members. We went an entire week without hot water and then when we made SEVERAL complaints to the front desk we were given a demonstration on how to turn on our water!!!! This was the most absurd thing we have ever experienced. From day one to check out we were running to get home. At night be sure to not walk alone because it is EXTREMELY dark not only outside, but in the rooms as well. The beach was DISGUSTING. Other resorts seemed to have the seaweed issue under control where this one clearly did not. We did not get to enjoy the beach or the ocean ONCE due to the amount of workers slowly PICKING UP THE SEAWEED WITH THEIR HANDS into TRASH bags that they placed in front of our suites!!!!! The smell was HORRENDOUS!!! Other people who were staying longer than us ended up switching resorts!

The Buffet lacked selection and much of the food was cold, often much of what was offered was not replenished.  ", "The Room, we paid for the upgraded VIP room - the room was of good size but very dated and in need of much repair - I had to repair the toilet myself 2x - the roof of the bathroom was a chunk of plastic as the drywall roof was falling off, the light switch had exposed wires and the walls had mold. The hinges to the doors are rusted, in the room there was a small balcony you could access except that the handle had broken off and rather than fix it they put furniture in front of it.  Additionally the cleaning staff neglected to clean my room for two days until I called complained.  Other things like no Wifi except in the lobby ( and that was intermittent )   and the fact that they let a bunch of street vendors onto the property for a flea market one night where I was harassed at least 20 times on my way to dinner was frikken awesome ( why stay at a resort? ) same with the beach but they were a little less aggressive.  The resort as a whole is run down and in a state of disrepair - feels like it was built in the 70's and no money invested since to upgrade or repair. Oh and the photo of all the beach beds ( they don't exist ) the pools were nice but not heated and due to the rain were very cold. Last but not least there are only 2 small stores on the resort and the prices are insanely high ( I understand you're on a resort ) but the staff are super rude and I watched as a customer had to ask 4 times about something before they would even acknowledge him - I would fire the lot of them.

So make sure you tip as the people around the resort really go out of their way to make this memorable for you. The days we were at the resort we took part on all the activities. At fist you just want to watch but you end up participating and actually having a fun. My idea from getting away from my business was just take in the sun but we ended up taking part on most of the activities. A person who definitely stood out was Ruber Perez.

After having experienced all that the Xhale Club has to offer, I can say that it's definitely the way to go! Our VIP host, Juan Carlos, was awesome and our stay wouldn't have been the same without all his help! He and the Xhale Club staff really went above and beyond. The resort was large enough but not too large. The various pools allowed you to join the party when you wanted but always find a quiet and relaxing spot as well when you needed it. The designated pool, private beach, dining and wait staff for Xhale Club members was such an added luxury!! I'm a very picky eater and I have to say that the food at all the resort restaurants we tried (and room service) was very good. We especially liked the Pacante restaurant. The grounds at Breathless were beautiful and very well kept. Overall, it was a great place to vacation and all the Xhale Club perks were such an added bonus!!!!"]},
{"hotel": ["Impressive Resort & Spa Punta Cana"], "title": ["Fabulous"], "content": ["I wanted to start this review by stating that I had a lot of trepidation after booking this resort due to so many negative reviews.   We went anyways as the cost for changing resorts was far too large.  We figured go and deal with what we will find as it comes our way.  All of the issues from the start to the finish were completely unfounded.  Check in was a breeze   maybe 15 minutes to wait, but have experienced that in more places than here.  The rooms were clean, ours was not huge but we only showered and slept there. Our 2 sons had a mix up with there room the first night, but was dealt with immediately the next morning with an upgrade I might add.  They received a huge room, yeah for them.  People were complaining about the beach,  honestly the beach was no different from anyone that we had been to before. Yes, there was seaweed coming in daily,  but wow, the crew was on it constantly.  Hats off to them for maintaining it so well. The grounds themselves,  well, what can we say were absolutely immaculate. I mean top notch. The restaurants had more then an ample of choices.   I myself am not a foodie,  but my one son and husband are and they were completely satisfied with all the choices and the menus.  The alcohol flowed freely,  for those who that is important too.  The entertainment crew, from the pool through to the stage and disco were bang on their game. The pools, gorgeous! Honestly I will recommend this resort over and over to anyone.   If I have to throw a negative comment in for the sake of doing so, it would be the pillows. Only as I like a very fluffy pillow myself and theirs are firm, LOL. I  also have a physical disability and this resort may not be set up to perfection for someone who may not be able to walk at all, but for me, I can walk a short distance,  everyone was so kind, helpful and accommodating.  We had an absolute fabulous holiday and left with very fond memories of it all.

It is the smaller of the Princess resorts and is adults only. The rooms were clean, AC worked and we always had hot water. We found the buffet had the best choices and as far as we were concerned the better food. Il Bacio was just OK. The Tex-Mex restaurant was way below expectations. We ordered the steak which was of the lowest quality with globs of inedible fat and very little meat. Stay Away. We used the Mare Nostrum as the daily snack bar. Again it was OK. Perfect for running up from the beach or the pool for a quick bite. The staff was generally friendly and accommodating. Shout out to Nelson at the pool bar, Papi Chocolate, and Pollo Loco. Also the staff at the buffet, especially Rafael ( I think that was his name) cooking eggs and omelets, every morning was attentive and friendly. The pool was never crowded, but you need to get a jump on it in the morning to get chairs. The beach does have a seaweed problem, but this a nature thing rather than the fault of the resort. There are workers working all day to clean up the seaweed. We did have 2-3 days seaweed free. Despite this issue the beach is beautiful. There are plenty of chairs on the beach. There are many excursions available and while we don't normally do any ( we prefer to chill ) we did go on the trip to Saona Island. It was a nice place but overall we only got to spend about 90 minutes on the beach and it was an all day trip. Won't do that again. Also, not the fault of the resort. My wife and I came with our son and his girlfriend and will be making plans to add more family next year."]},

They have a show every night at 9 PM for 45 minutes and then after the show there is a DJ for one hour but at 11 PM the party ends. They do have a 'disco' club you can go to afterwards that's open until 1 AM but it is always empty and the music was all in Spanish and not party music.

Second reason the staff Emilia lovely woman who made sure my room was clean everyday Margarita the cleaning manager Domingo my towel guy lol Yasmin that made my birthday sooo special and set up the table and had the staff sing me happy Birthday Rosie & Jasmine who also made it special @ the end of the night in the lobby. Reynaldo  and the crew in the Tiki Bar after me walking to the back of the resort to the 24/hr they also made me feel safe and very friendly. Emilo the front lobby bartender the warmth of that guy you can just chill @ his bar all day and drink and laugh. The staff @ the buffet the best as you walk in you get the good morning and the good evening loved it. The last reason why i give it the five star Hilda! After being the the itchy sun for the last 6days of my stay i started to blister up and i was burnt very bad. I went to the front desk and Hilda was with someone and i went to her while she was on the phone and this lady put her call on hold and told me please don't move. she told the people she was with to please give her a min, she right away jump on the phone and called an outside Pharmacy ask them what they can give me, she had them deliver it to the resort she sat with me until they got there told me what to do and then said she was going to call me room to check up on me.

It was quickly resolved by us apologizing for not locking our safe and assuring Security that we didn't have anything in it to begin with. We appreciated their response and we were glad to see policies being followed.  Beyond that we saw Security several times making sure that some overly intoxicated guests were safe and being looked after and even helping some of them get back to their room. You can definitely tell that it's a big priority there.", "Special Events: We arrived on my birthday which was noted when we booked our reservation and were also asked about it during check-in. On our room door had the Breathless Happy Birthday banner, a card for a free bottle of Champagne brought to our room was on the desk, a personal Birthday cake was delivered to our room that evening and that night at dinner rather than the dessert I ordered they brought me out a large platter of chocolate covered strawberries which were more than I could finish, but still delicious.

There were some negative experiences but all in all our stay was very good. The grounds are lovely and very well kept.  You can walk to any amenity in a few minutes. One of the reasons I chose this resort is because I wanted to avoid having to take a trolley to get anywhere. I have been to many resorts in Punta Cana and would rate this a 4 star.  Although our room was not ready until 3 hours after we arrived, it was very clean, well decorated, had a lovely bathroom and a great ocean view.  It was never cleaned until at least 4pm everyday (despite leaving constant tips) and we had to ask for more water/drinks etc several times.  The balcony chairs are extremely uncomfortable and would be improved with some comfortable weather proof cushions. Fabio at the front desk made check-in a breeze.

Beach venders did not bother us and there were security guards every few feet on the beach to deter unwanted venders.  Pools were lovely and clean and again no trouble find a chair.", "We enjoyed four of the a la carte restaurants. Best service was at the Olive Tree. You need reservations for the Japanese but the meal was great.  We enjoyed the food at the French restaurant but service is very slow as it is at suppertime at the grill. Steaks were done perfectly though.  The service at the Italian restaurant was so bad we left.  After 45 minutes of sitting there we received nothing.", "The food at the buffet was not as good as at other resorts.  Hot food was never more than luke warm unless freshly made such as an omelette.  Cold scrambled eggs every morning.  Their warming trays are not effective whatsoever. Very difficult to get coffee in morning.  Often had to ask for it three times.  Service at lunch and supper (when we went) was good because of a very smart, very attentive supervisor named Yaniris Santana.  This supervisor was an incredible asset to this resort.  I would hire her in an instant.  Her presence was one of quite authority.  While serving customers her eyes were constantly scanning the tables to ensure good service.  She never missed even the smallest mistake or attention to detail. The smallest infraction was pointed out to her employees in a calm, polite manner but she meant business.   I hope the resort sees her strong work ethic and potential for promotion.  ", "I usually had good service at bars but was clearly told I could not be served at the Emerald Bar because it was for \u201cpremium\u201d clients.

The water at the beach was disappointing it is cleaner in padre island tx. I expected blue water that you could see your feet but you have no visual.i was so disappointed I'm a beach person and only went to the beach 2 times and didn't spend 10 minutes in it because of the water. So I spent my entire time I. The pool"]},

We paid extra for an ocean view room and our room was right on the beach!  This was much better then we could have ever anticipated.  The room was very clean, with a large closet, large drawers to store our clothes, a safe, a fridge stocked daily according to our preferences, a walk in shower with a separate hand held shower head to rinse our feet, room darkening curtains and privacy curtains, and great air conditioning.  The beds were very firm, but not uncomfortably so and the pillows suited the firmness of the beds.  The food was great!  The international buffet was perfect for each of us and the variety left nothing to be desired.  The restaurants were available for as many times as we wanted, but we never felt the need to try one, as the buffet was so tasty and the service was efficient and friendly.  The grounds were beautiful and well maintained.  Although the beach front was a bit narrower compared to other places we have stayed, there was always enough beach and enough room for our chairs.  This resort does not have beach umbrellas, but there are enough trees for shade.  They have a beach volleyball area which was very popular.  The staff was on hand to start matches twice per day and they were fun to watch.  The pool area was popular with many of the guests, but for ourselves, we preferred the quiet surroundings of the beach.  The poolside music and activities did not disturb us as the wind was always from the ocean and the noise was carried away from us.  The resort was not too large and a walk from one corner to the other only took 5 minutes.  There were convenient beach side and poolside food and beverage vendors, including pizza/nachos/hotdogs, fruit and drinks.  One of our favorite activities was a sunrise and a sunset walk along the beach.  We could walk forever in either direction.  While the ocean did deposit some seaweed on the beach at high tide, the staff all along the shoreline was very busy cleaning it up and this resort was no exception.  I would recommend this resort without hesitation, because there was nothing we disliked about it."]},

{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["PUNTA CANA PRINCESS - Adults Resort - Need to Dispell Some Myths"], "content": ["Hi Folks. Just returned from Princess Punta Cana, aka Punta Cana Princess, aka Punta Cana Princess Adult Resort & Spa. There seems to be some confusion regarding the name and similar names used for several resorts in the area. When I read some of the reviews before departing I was concerned but it turns out I needn't have been worried. The resort is very clean and modern. It is truly a 5-star resort based on cleanliness, food quality and additional services offered. The reception is very good; English was perfect, staff polite and responsive. The other staff in the resort spoke only basic English but were friendly and polite. I saw some reviews that say the staff is unfriendly but I suspect that is due to the language barrier. I travelled with my chiquita from Peru whose mother tongue is Spanish and all staff were very friendly with us because she spoke Spanish. The food is excellent. I can't find fault with the buffet or the restaurants onsite. The wine and beer served were acceptable. They had a wine list available in the restaurants if you wanted to order a fancy wine and pay for it. The coffee was very good at the lobby bar and the buffet bar; coffee at the snack bar was just ok. The alcohol served at the bar at the beach(cocktails and beer) was also very good and the service was fine. The seaweed in the water was bad but not so bad as to prevent us from swimming. Despite their efforts, there was a lot of seaweed washed up on the beach which looked bad. There were ants at the beach. We received several bites. Lots of mosquitoes at night even in the buffet and lobby areas. The room was very clean and modern. Air conditioning and overhead ceiling fan worked very well - we were actually cold at one point. The animation team worked hard. The night shows were mixed. Sunday night was Karaoke which is only as good as you make it- they need audience participation. Monday night was a boring standard resort show called Miss Punta Cana which relied heavily on audience participation - very silly and boring. Tuesday night we went to the Caribe Princess resort next door to go to see the African show which was excellent! Wednesday was the Michael Jackson show in the Princess Resort lobby - also excellent! Thursday was a Beach party - great fun!! and Friday they had live music with a band that was sensational! These guys really put on a show - Merengue, Salsa, Bachata, rock, pop, etc. Fantastico! Finally, there are tennis courts there - very nice clay courts at Club Caribe next door and one hard court at the Princess. THe Pro is Manuel and he is very good and is available for only $20 per hour! Bring your tennis shoes and racket! The pictures that are posted on Trip Advisor are accurate. The Washrooms are CLEAN. Yes, thank God for that. The toilets flush and there is hot water. The resort is clean and modern and good value for the money. Now, here are my tips to travellers and to management: TIPS TO TRAVELLERS: 1) Relax, chill, calm down. This is Dom Rep and they operate at a different speed than us. Slow down. Everything will be fine. Yelling at someone on staff will get you nowhere and is not classy. 2) Bring OFF Deep Woods with DEET - you will thank me later. 3) Learn some Spanish before going. You will need basic phrases to make things go smoothly. 4) pay a little more for the OCEAN VIEW rooms. We were in room 5216 which had an amazing view of beach and ocean 5) Do the excursion to Santo Domingo - it is beautiful and very interesting. TIPS FOR MANAGEMENT: 1) give some English lessons to all your staff so they understand some English. 2) Promote the tennis - you have great courts and a good pro in Manuel but you need to mention it more on your website and literature. 3) PICK UP THE SEAWEED!! You have a gorgeous beach. Too bad you have dead seaweed lying around. In Cuba and in Mexico they use a small truck or tractor to help pick it up and remove it each day - you should do the same. 4) Night time entertainment could be better. It would be good if you could fill the time slot from 8pm to 9:30 pm with something - DJ with music, live music, magician, jugglers, whatever, just something. Special mention to Raul in Buffet, Chicken Crazy and Rosy and Chocolina in Animation as well as Manuel in Tennis who all did a great job. Thanks for reading!"]},

As others have said - NOT a 4.5 OR 5 Star -  Bottom line : Just don't expect 4.5 star when your booking and you wont be disappointed. Overall : Resort is good, and we had a great time. Most Likely Your AC wont work properly, and WIFI is terrible. Bring Bug Spray: Just remember you get what you pay for-  For a more detailed review please keep reading: ", "SERVICE  : Staff Members are very friendly and kind. The Friendliest we have experienced at any resort - and the staff are what save this resort- so I hope management appreciates them. They never make you feel like you need to be tipping them, and they are always smiling and dancing and bringing up the vibe. Please tip the ones who are always taking care of you. They appreciate it and will go the extra mile for you. Service at the Buffet or A La Carte restaurants are not that great- They forget to bring you food and drinks. We sometimes had to ask 3 times- and sometimes, we would completely finish our meal before the drinks even came ( Coke, Water or coffee) ", "Room : We had room 4223 - with the vaulted ceilings, which was really nice. King sized bed was also AWESOME. When we got there, the TV remote didn't work. As others have posted, the AC never went cooler than 27c (80.6F). It took 4 days and me finally making a manager request before the TV remote got fixed and AC got 'looked' at. At night the lowest it went was 25c (77F)  I gave up on the AC , Front desk is useless. When you only have 7 days, you don't want to wait around for these guys to do their job. 5 of 6 couples had the EXACT same issue. AC not working on a tropical getaway? That's just nonsense and they don't care.  Upper level flooded every time we showered, but didn't really affect us, just something worth mentioning. ", "FOOD: Depends on who you ask, some say it is really good, others will say its awful.", "Overall food was just  OK, some real good and some not so great, but never bad. And neither of us got sick or had any weird stomach issues so that's always a good thing for a Caribbean resort. ", "VIP : The golden question : Should i get it?? If you fly with Sunwing from Canada, its automatically included. Most likely because people who where paying extra for it in the past complained. Would I pay extra for it ? Personally, no. You get to use the Bali beds by the beach which was pretty nice. and also free room service (which we never used) But that was about it. They promise you Premium brand drinks - To Bad they never have any in stock. One day they had Black Label Johnny walker, next day 'no stock'. CMON!!! We also got 2 Budweiser every day in our mini fridge at no extra charge. (Big Deal) we drank them out of principle.", "WIFI : You have to pay 18 USD for 7 days for in room WIFI- and its the slowest Wifi in world. Better than nothing, but needs to be improved. Just a mention if you need it for work or other related purposes. Its almost useless ", "THE GOOD:  24 hour Food and drink bar is just amazing. Located off the beach with a beautiful patio with lots of seating. Awesome during the day, and Perfect for that late night drink or snack with your significant other or for meeting some cool people and chatting the night away.  We met a lot of nice people from all over - which may not happen on your visit, but the overall vibe is good. Beach Bar is very close to the beach and you never have to travel far for your drinks. No reservations are required which is nice too.  Don't worry about dress code : there is none- almost everyone wore shorts and sandles to a La Carte diners. Most do dress well though as they should :). ", "BEACH: Beach is really nice, but Seaweed a real issue this year. Most resorts in Punta Cana are having this issue.  Most days it wasn't that bad, and by no means  the resorts Fault.  They maybe could help it by investing in a tractor to collect it and groom the beach every morning, as it would be more efficient than having a bunch of workers every morning gathering and collecting them in garbage bags.", "Message to Management : Fix your Ac issues, and address complaints right away- this will fix half your reviews - Don't reply to me - you didn't care to address my issues when i was there- so i have no interest in your response", "Special shout out to new friends from Modesto and Kansas City"]},

The couch was a bit worn and the chairs on the balcony coul be better. The fridge had Budweiser, coke and sprite.

We did not visit the Mediterranean or Japanese restaurants so can't comment.   We had 2 meals at the Grill which were both disappointing.  So-so food the first time.  2nd time my wife had the ribs which had almost no meat while I was served a meal I didn't order.  We ate once at the Italian restaurant which was good and had the best waiter.  French restaurant was outstanding the first time but horrible the second time.  Lost our order (beef fillets).

We spent most of our time at the beach pool which was close to the snack area as well as the beach bar.  The family pool is large with a swim-up bar.  The relaxing pool was smaller but quieter with its own bar.  We weren't \"premium\" guests so can't comment on the lake pool.", "Three areas need improvement.  WiFi needs to be included with all rooms.  We spent over an hour at the front desk because they had to activate each device themselves (only 2 devices per room).

This resort is beautiful and very well laid out with a huge pool. The beach is gorgeous and we enjoyed the long walks in both directions. The restaurants all have great decor and seating plans. The food was good and plentiful but in most cases was not an amazing meal. The biggest turn off for us was the smoking which is everywhere.

I'll start with why I think this is a good hotel:", "The main things I really liked were the hotel grounds, the food and the staff. The grounds are very beautiful with lots of trees, bushes and flowers and they are also kept very neat and clean. So when you are walking around the hotel you really feel like you're in a Caribbean paradise. ", "I also really liked the food. I was surprised to read a lot of reviews complaining about the food at the buffet restaurant because I thought it was very good. However, I will admit that the lunch buffet was not the best I've eaten. But the breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet was excellent! I liked that they have a different theme (like Italian, Dominican etc.) for dinner every day and there is always so much food to choose from so you can always find something that you like. ", "Lastly, I also really liked the staff! Most of them are very friendly and will give you great service. I would like to say thank you to Yosaira (in the bar) who is great! And I would also like to say an extra special thank you to Daniel, who works in the restaurant. Daniel is both very kind and excellent at his job. Punta Cana Princess is truly lucky to have someone as good as Daniel working there. ", "The two things that I didn't like and that made me only give four stars were the seaweed and the salesmen. I don't know if this is a seasonal thing (I was there in June) but the beach was covered in seaweed and the water was full of it too. It's not seaweed that grows, like, on the bottom, it's \"loose\" seaweed that comes in with the waves and there is so much of it! I was there for two weeks and there were only 3 days when the water was not full of floating seaweed. The hotel spends a lot of time cleaning up the seaweed on the beach but it's kind of a losing battle and the water is also still full of it. This is of course not something that the hotel can do much about because as we all know, the ocean and Mother Nature can't be controlled. It does however ruin the \"Caribbean paradise feeling\". So if seaweed is an issue for you then this is probably not the hotel for you, at least not in June. ", "The other thing that I didn't like was the salesmen. I was there because I wanted to relax and basically just lie on the beach and read my book. There are a lot of salesmen walking around on the beach every day and the ones who are selling activites/excursions are always trying to get you to buy something. So it wasn't very relaxing to be bothered every day by people telling me that I can't just lie on the beach reading, that I have to do something, even though I have said very clearly that that is exactly what I want to do. Also, if you're a single women traveling alone then whatever you do, when they ask you where your husband is, do not tell them that you don't have one because then they will try to get you to marry them. So unless that's why you're there, just tell people that your husband is at home waiting for you even if you don't have one. ", "Lastly I should also mention something about tipping. It can be good to know that you kind of are expected to tip. I was totally unprepared for this for several reasons. Firstly because it says when you book the hotel that tip is included and secondly because I have never even heard of an all inclusive hotel where you are supposed to tip. And lastly, because I am from Sweden. In Sweden we do not tip. In fact, it makes me very uncomfortable to tip because it makes me feel like I pay people to be nice to me. As if I think that they are only being nice to me because I give them money and that feels so rude. I know that this probably makes no sense to the Americans reading this but my fellow Northen Europeans probably know what I'm talking about. Anyway, I thought I should mention to future guests that you kind of are expected to tip because when some of the staff realised that I don't tip, the service I received was a bit less good. Not bad but also not as good as it had been. And I also want to clarify that this is not true for the whole staff, or even for most of the staff, but only for a few staff members. Anyway, like I said, I just thought I should point it out so that future guests can be more prepared. ", "All in all I did have a good time at this hotel, mainly because of the beautiful grounds, the tasty food and the friendly staff (especially Yosaira and Daniel :) )! But because of the seaweed and the pushy salesmen I would also not come back a second time. ", "But like I said, it is a great hotel so I do recommend people to book it! :)"]},

You blew my mind the moment that you told me that you don\u2019t drink so you couldn\u2019t recommend a drink for Angela and myself and that made me not want to have anything else besides water. When we return we hope to see you and give you a big hug, because you truly were so incredible to us no matter where you were and I now know that we have great family like yourself in Dominican Republic that will always make us feel welcomed. Thank you so much for providing excellent customer service, always sharing nice conversation with us and reminding us of a loved one that we now value whenever we are in the DR.   ", "Francis,", "We first met you at the Steakhouse in the Punta Cana Princess and there was so many customers in attendance that night along with a sorority group of about 30 and you handled all of us so well. I thought you were going to ask me to either leave or turn off my mini radio but you came over with a warm smile and complimented the music. You really made my day from that day forward. That\u2019s why I lit up with excitement every time I saw you. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with Angela and I every moment you saw us. You are such a great friend and Hilda spoke very highly of you when I was trying to recall your name and that made me even more happy to have met and befriended someone as personable", "Luis,", "Luis I just want to say that I love you like a brother.

Each time you saw me you always helped me understand the menu for food and even shared some of your chef specialty dishes with me (such as fish, shrimp, chicken and bbq).

Thank you so much for taking great care of us. We appreciate you.", "Hilda,", "It is very hard to write a review for you.

You and two other gentleman took a photo of us and informed us that we could purchase the photo if we wanted but that we did not have to buy it. I respect you so much for that. So many people at the resort kept stopping us and trying to get us to buy things but your approach was more sincere. You my friend are truly a great person.", "Oscar,", "Let me start by saying \"yeah baby!\" One of the things I loved about you was that you were always dancing and inspiring the customers to move their feet to any song that was playing. You have a great personality and I am proud to call you my friend.", "Raul,", "When people walked by they called me by your name by accident several times and they were disappointed when they saw I was not Raul. That says a lot about your skills as a server. You have impressed many people including my wife and I. Thank you so much for having a great attitude, wonderful personality and you recognized me from a distance with every encounter. You have great customer service skills and a great smile that pulls in the customers. Thank you so much for making this vacation a blast and memorable.

You guys and gals are a huge part of anyone\u2019s vacation and I hope you all are always recognized because you all provide us with drinks that allow the most timid of people the opportunity to let go and be free. Thank you all so much for enhancing our vacation with your great customer service skills, fast response time and up beat personalities.", "Unknown Hostess - (young lady at the Punta Cana Princess buffet)", "To the first server that we've encountered. I am terribly sorry that I did not get your name, but I'll use my technical skills and background to find you and send another positive review on your behalf. Each time you saw my wife and I you immediately greeted us with a smile and a warm hug. You helped me decide what drinks we would like without knowing us but looking at us and that was impressive. The last day we saw you was when you worked the weekend at the buffet with Cristobalina and you honestly became the reason why other employees recognized us.", " ", "It is because of the names above that I've been bragging about the Punta Cana Princess resort. I hope my review aides in recognizing the great potential you have with staffing and if you could share this with them it will surely make me happy. The common thing to say is that they deserve a raise, and though that is true I also believe that each individual that was named displays great leadership skills and could do great with a promotion to assist any newly hired staff member to perform a job of excellence just as they have with us. After leaving Dominican Republic, we've come home with many loving memories and have since made many friends. I've shared with many people that they will benefit greatly from planning their next vacation at your location and I've heard responses of friends that are planning trips your way soon. Thank you all for making my first trip outside the US a great experience. Thank you all for being above outstanding and being considered as a part of our family. We love you all so much and look forward to seeing you again soon. Blessings and good health to you all."]},

Plenty of food options, Plenty of bar options, plenty of pool options. Friendly helpful staff, clean rooms, well stocked mini bar ETC.. SUGGESTIONS, must do the Hemingway bar, Boghali restaurant. Secret pool is the best for a quiet adults day! Sports bar is good for a late night snack. Argentine steak house was good but the dinner for two was way too much for two! SPA is awesome... CONS, shower in our room was a pain and hot water was an issue at peak hours. Lines could be a little long at the alacarte places if you get there after 7 PM. Sometimes drinks and such can be a little slow at the buffet in peak hours but these people work a ton of hours/days and really try and I never felt unwelcome. Timeshare guys will bug you a little but after a few days of saying no they give up... None of these issues were a big deal for us. I would book this resort again in a heartbeat and just might do that! SPECIAL acknowledge to Ismael the pool guy at the Punta Cana pool who went out of his way to blow up ALL of our floats... he spotted us trying to do this manually and came over and offered help.

Rooms are small, dark, and have disgusting bathrooms. Fortunately the weather is beautiful so you don't spend much time in the room. The bathroom was really hard to get past, though. While you cannot beat the view and feel of the beach, there is no service on the beach or even a beach bar. The pool is the perfect temperature with plenty of chairs and shady spots, but no swim up bar and sparse service. Only good restaurant is the Japanese hibachi one, everywhere else will leave you hungry and disappointed. Drinks are absolutely horrible! Frozen tropical drinks taste like chemicals and the only included liquor is the well kind that tastes like rubbing alcohol, even if you upgrade to the premium level (which we had). Also don't think you'll be able to get anything to eat or drink after midnight on the adults only side- instead you have to take the tram or walk 10 minutes to the other side, where the disco and casino are disappointing. The worst part of the whole trip was the miserable attitude and manners of the staff. Regardless of how well we tipped, every staff member acted completely put out when we would ask for something. The bartenders were surly and unhelpful when asked for a recommendation. The concierges at the premium lounge were the only pleasant people we encountered.

{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Our 2nd *Enjoyable stay*"], "content": ["My spouse and I resided for 7 nights at the Punta Cana Princess (Adult only resort) from Jan 26th to Feb 2nd, 2019. We arrived around 12:30 hrs.. The check in was quick and well explained by the employee. Our room block #4, 2nd floor was not ready. We were told to go eat, enjoy the sun and to return after 3 PM. We enjoyed our lunch and the beach. We returned to the reception around 4:30 PM and our room was ready and our luggage had been taken to our room already. Our room was nice & clean. All rooms face the pool/garden area which is well kept by many gardeners. The corridor & entrance door for the rooms is at the back (towards the resort ground limits). Once you enter the room: the closet (2 louvered sliding doors) has: approx. 12 wood hangers, an iron/ironing board an umbrella and two white bath robes with slippers. Then you have 4 shelves and a free digital safe. The washroom layout is nice: toilet with frosted door, walk in shower with frosted door (had 2 options for the shower: a hand held shower head or the rainfall type), a modern sink and a wall mounted hairdryer with a night light. The water pressure and hot water were always good/ available. There is no door to enter the washroom area. Between the washroom area and the bedroom you have a hot tub with jets (we did not try it). The AC worked fine for the duration of our stay. We had a king size bed which we found comfortable and there are light switches on both sides of the bed. There is a ceiling fan above the bed which we enjoyed. Then you have 2 steps down living area with a sofa (sliding hide a bed), sofa table, a round table with 2 chairs and a fridge. The flat screen TV (wall mounted) has many channels to select from: approx. 15 English channels (CTV, CNN, movie channels, etc\u2026), 1 French (TV5) and many Spanish with some having the translation to English at the bottom. The patio door curtains are very opaque. Our balcony was private 2 chairs + small table, (some rooms have their balcony next to the neighbours\u2019 balcony). Our maid service was excellent & we always had our fridge (2 beers, 3 X 500 ml soft drinks & a 1.5 L. water bottle) & bathroom towels/items... replenished when needed.  Our maid created different bed ornaments on a daily basis. The food was very good at all the locations we ate: Buffet (variety of meats, fish, pastas, cold cuts, breads, cheeses, fresh fruits/vegetables, jams, peanut butter, ice cream, yogurts, deserts, condiments, syrups, etc...). there is also the breakfast/lunch restaurant near beach but it is not as elaborate as the main buffet. We went to the steak, Italian & fondue A la Carte restaurants. We enjoyed all of them but our favourite was the Italian which we attended three times. No reservations are needed and we only waited once (15 minutes) to be seated at the Italian restaurant. We did not try the Seafood restaurant near the beach. We were told it was delicious and plan on trying it the next time we return. The service at all the bars was excellent even the vacationers who did not tip received their service with a smile. The pool was kept clean and the water was clear throughout the whole day. We enjoyed the sloped easy walk in entrance to the pool (near mini Spa area). We really appreciated the locations of all the washrooms. The one near the pool/beach area was used by many pool users.... All washrooms were kept clean. The ones next to the buffet and the one in the lobby area have been renovated and are very modern. To obtain a sun umbrella/long chairs at the beach, you had to arrive early. Some vacationers reserved the umbrella/long chairs at the beach and the pool area very early in the morning. This was different from our last year experience. The long chairs have a comfortable beige/brown fabric. The location of the Punta Cana Princess is ideal for beach walkers. You can walk either way (East/West) for very long distances. The Beach is amazing, white sand and amazing blueish/green ocean water. There was some salespersons walking the beach and trying to get your attention. But, once you told them that you were not interested they did not bother you. Wi-Fi was free in the lobby area. It worked fine for us. We did not attend any night show as we had long days at the beach. The guests are mostly from Canada, USA and Europe. The hotel is quiet, no loud music/noise at night. The gym located in the Spa building is a short walk from the lobby area (off resort grounds). It is small, but there is enough exercise equipment and all are functional. There are hand towels and a large water bottle with cups in the gym area. We had our usual spot at the buffet area and we really appreciated the service we received from Juana Iris, Carlos, Ariel and many others. The hard working hotel personnel are ALL wonderful, friendly & give you an excellent service with a smile. My spouse called the client services desk for a toilet handle repair. The service was very quick (within a few minutes) and the issue was solved right away. We even had a few follow ups by client services on our degree of satisfaction, which we appreciated as we were always fully satisfied of their repair person (fixed toilet handle & towel rack in shower area) and resort in general.

It's grueling and useless."], "content": ["The rating in this review is the result of many positives and one very huge negative.", "First let's take the positive. My spouse and I are Club Melia members and have been visiting this property for over 11 years. The property is beautiful, the entertainment is suburb and the service staff is wonderful. A special shout out to our club Melia concierge Hiro, our usual breakfast server Benjamin Luis and to our beach attendant Felipe Morla who made our stay and our guests stay especially delightful. We would go back and encourage others to come and enjoy this property. If the review, ended here, I would give them 5 Stars. But there is on big negative to this experience that rips away four of those stars:  The Circle Club hard sell sales pitch. ", "Here's how they rope you in. You will be told that its just a few minutes to go over additional benefits if you are a Melia member, or an opportunity if you are non-member. After a buffet breakfast in the Circle Club property, you will be subjected to one of the most grueling hard sell experiences designed to wear you down to the point where you will sign anything just to get out of the sales lounge and back to the pool or beach. If you are a Club Melia member, the added benefits for what can gain for up to $79,000 US paid over a period of 7 years is minimal. (Like a cab to pick you up at the airport (I can get a private car to take us to the property and back to the airport for about $88 in Punta Cana by calling Otium International, or I can simply take a regular taxi for the 25 minute ride for about $30 and a small tip each way). The bottom line is that Circle Club is just a scheme to get Melia Club members to pony up more money for nothing more than fluff). Anything they offer to Circle Club Members, I can get as a Melia Club member if I am willing to pay a little more money when I want it. (For example, I can get Royal service by paying more for that week). As for the restaurants that are exclusive to the Circle Club and the so-called higher quality food, I've seen better and enjoyed better in the States, Europe and South America. In short, this offer has terrible ROI. It's like you're buying a whole cow in order to have an occasional glass of milk.", "The sales meeting  is very high pressure. It starts innocently enough with talk about the features, higher quality food in the restaurants and and other ego-pleasing amenities that have very little substantial value. If they detect that you are not getting hooked they bring more people to continue to sweeten the pie, by say offering some discounts.  After this so called 90 minute discussion turns into a three and half hour hard sell where a polite, \"okay, I've got it, we would like to leave now and evaluate\" is met with the reply, \"let me show you one more thing,\" it becomes clear that they will never voluntarily let you go until you buy. At this point, we finally found it necessary to be overtly rude, get up, collect our friends (who were being subjected to same hard sell) and start to walk out. At that point another, more senior fellow came over and offered us a huge discount that would expire the minute we walked out the door. I said no thank you and finally they relented and called a golf cart to take us and our guest back to the Paradisus resort. (Personally, I think they gave up at this point because my anger was showing they were afraid of the impact it might have on the other people they were trying to sell). ", "In any event, the cost of this loss of half a day to them is four stars of what would otherwise would have been a stellar review. To be clear, their service staff did a marvelous job which earns them a top rating, but their sales staff are doing a great disservice to members and their guests who are there to enjoy a relaxing vacation.", "The bottom line is that we are committed to never attending one of those club sell events ever again. (I'm sure they will come up with some other gimmick in a few years to get Circle Club members to upgrade for some other phantom benefits so they can squeeze out a bit more cash). That's the unfortunate ugly side of what otherwise is a nice placer to visit. ", "We urge you not to waste precious vacation  time with you friends and/or families attending this high pressure, completely useless sales pitch"]},

Wife and I stayed in the standard suite and it was much more than sufficient to our standards (we are pretty basic and are not high maintenance). The main lobby is basically immaculately well kept. ", "2. The room was fine. Although we don't have high standards, the bed has to be comfortable as I have a bad back and I can say the bed was amazing. The room size more than sufficed. It was however dated, and our safe didn't work but that was fixed within half an hour.", "3. Service was good. Room service was O.K. (we requested a wine opener for the bottle they gave us but had to call 3 times before it arrived). That being said, the resort is huge, so don't expect to have someone bring you something right away unless by chance they are already nearby. Service at the restaurants was great, although staff can be a bit friendlier, I can say specifically that at Fuego, the staff were over the top pleasant and brought us fun drinks and sang with us. The service at the bar was good as well, staff are quick and efficient, drinks are pretty consistent. ", "Extra curricular activities were great. Michael Jackson show was amazing and the resort had a silent disco in the lobby where you put on some listeners and chose from three stations to listen to different varieties of music which was a ton of fun. There was a staff member who would organize beach volleyball every day throughout the day which was great. ", "Food was amazing. Here are the absolute best restaurants we have been to on any resort (Mexico and Cuba) rated from top to bottom (keep in mind bottom was still amazing).", "1. FUEGOOOO - we went 3 times, and all 3 times ordered the mouth watering steak. My moth is literally watering right now. ", "2. Vento - Mediterranean - Our meals were amazing and beautiful restaurant", "3. Aqua - Italian - we had spaghetti both times, and it was cooked to perfection", "4. Mole - Mexican - amazing Mexican food, taco's were awesome and the enchilada's were even better", "5. Bana - were not big sushi fans but this restaurant has other options, we had steak and shrimp fried up right in front of us and it was delicious  .", "6. The Grill - only reason why this is at the bottom is because I ordered the rib eye and being from Canada, I guess it's a different cut. It was nothing like a regular rib eye and I was very disappointed. We did not return but only because we wanted to try out all the a la carte's.", "CONS", "1. Ok, we had a rather alarming experience, now that we think about it, it makes sense BUT needs to be handled differently. OUR SAFE WAS BROKEN WHEN WE ARRIVED. So, we thought, O.k. we just got here, we can call tonight and have it fixed, let's just get to the beach ASAP and put our belongings in the safe anyway and closed it (wallets, passports and my watch). So, that we did, and upon our arrival, our hotel room door was wide open and there were two staff members one of which had my wife's wallet in his hands and her I.D's were out, the other guy had my passport. We immediately told them to drop everything and asked who they were and to provide identification. They explained that when a safe is broken, their standard procedure is to go through the belongings and take notes, to ensure that nothing goes missing and if we were to claim that something did, they would have it documented. They also ordered a new safe.They did not seem awkward with the encounter at all, almost as if it had happened before, they were very calm even though we were livid. This indicated to me that it was perhaps a standard procedure. We went to the service manager right away and she confirmed that this was the case and apologized. ", "2. There is definitely a few gangs of locals who run \"services\" within the resort. My background is in investigations and naturally, I am observant, from day 1 I noticed a girl, always on her phone texting, morning through to the night walking around the pool, the lobby and the beach, chatting it up with the bar tenders and reporting back to a colleague white Caucasian heavily tattooed and well dressed. This girl would get a phone call or a text, then run back to the tattoo guy and they would all get up and scurry away, disappear for an hour then come back. Sometimes, the girl would recruit some young girl, bring her to meet the tattoo guy shake hands and they would all hang out. ", "My wife and I being social butterfly's, also met a local girl who was bubbly and lots of fun, loved to dance at the Gabi beach bar one night. I noticed she was with two males and another female who appeared to be in a relationship with one of the males. The other male was sitting on the wall alone and just watching. The girl danced with my wife and I, she was very friendly.. and began talking about making plans with us the next day. We were all dancing with a wedding party who were heavily intoxicated and one of the girls through her drink on the local girl, not sure why but it ignited some major drama with the two males that were with the local girl. It appeared that they were confronting the intoxicated girls boyfriend and were getting aggressive. I then approached one of the males and said, just relax man were all on vacation, and tried to play it off as an accident. The male (who's girlfriend was the other female with them) was furious, and he replied \"I let you dance with my girl, now step away from me\" I said \"let me dance with your girl? what does that even mean\". The next day we couldn't help but notice them everywhere we were, drinking for free as locals on a resort, they knew every staff member, fist pumps and laughs. Something fishy there.", "All this to say, my wife and I did not feel comfortable at this resort after these experiences. Thankfully it was near the end of our stay. Being on vacation and looking to relax, but knowing there are gangs of locals hanging out in the resort, not being subtle and quite aggressive, is alarming."]},

So much good food to choose from in the buffet and then to relax a while before Sugar ( Moises) started with the Agua zumba or the bike spinning in the pool . Sugar made it so much fun and kept us on our toes everyday . We tried many of the A La carte Restaurants which were all good . As is mentioned before , some service could have been a bit quicker , but hey we were on holiday , so it was no big problem . The rooms were comfortable and spacious , we had ground floor rooms 71\u2014, so was great sitting on our patio watching the people and trolley cars go up and down . Personally I cannot fault anything ( apart from the guys trying to get us to go to special breakfasts or lunches ) . We were warned about this so was easy for us to decline without wasting our time .

LaPalapa is the restaurant where Royal Service guests can go- ordering drinks and food is very slow!! Good to have options other than a buffet, but it takes way too long. We ate in Naos one day for a quick lunch, and the Dorado from the grill was good. Juan at the Royal Service pool bar was great!

The white beach is beautiful, as was the ocean. We stayed at all inclusive in Jamaica prior to coming here, and we were not allowed to tip- here, everyone wants tips. I wish they could come up with a similar system, so tips are not expected, but in our costs. I do not like carrying money around on a beach or pool. Tipping a butler or private service such as a massage makes total sense, and we gladly tipped them well. We had a couples massage on the beach with Maria and Ellie and they were fabulous! Gabi, who worked with our group and extending stays was great. I was also disappointed that the site says watersports are included,  but only the pool is included. In Jamaica, we had paddle boards, kayaks, snorkeling, sailing, tubing all included with our resort. We had a good time, as we enjoyed our workmates and friends and we can enjoy ourselves most places, but when comparing this resort with Sandals in Jamaica, it does not compare.

On all the websites the room I was wrongly placed in was platinum (matched the pictures), not to mention the room that was supposed to come with additional perks did not. It was also poorly cleaned and infested with ants. I spoke to Hilda from guest services she was fantastic she sent up all the additional amenities. Ramon was accommodating as well. Food is average not much variety, buffets are very small as is the resort. Honeymoon suite was excellent and very clean. Not much going on with animation.

There were salsa lessons in the lobby every night to a variety of latin music, Gabi Beach's bar had more popular music and a DJ in case we wanted a change of pace, every morning there was either Zumba or yoga, and some evenings had rum or wine tastings.The grounds are gorgeous and well maintained and quiet despite the numerous activities every night.

{"hotel": ["Barcelo Bavaro Beach Adults Only"], "title": ["Can't wait to come back!!"], "content": ["We're a 55-year-old married couple and we really dug the place! My first panic over there being no beach umbrellas was quickly erased. We like shade and absolutely require it all day. But there truly are enough palm trees to keep your lounge chairs shaded as long as you\u2019re willing to move your chairs a bit more often than with palapas. We did happen to be located almost at the end of the resort, in room 2046, and the farther you get to either end, the less crowded it is. So we never had a problem, at any time of day, getting great \u201cseats\u201d on the beach \u2013 which true to its reputation, is absolutely one of the most beautiful tropical beaches anywhere, and we\u2019ve seen quite a few. The very numerous palm trees ON the beach, not behind it, have a lot to do with that. Our room was great and had a s-p-e-c-t-a-c-u-l-a-r view of the beach. As a corner room, the view was even better than the ones between two rooms. Loved the balcony, too \u2013 it seems like in other rooms we\u2019ve stayed in, the railing was too high to sit in a chair and still be able to see the view (\u2018m only 5\u20194\u201d), but that just wasn\u2019t a problem with this place. Could have sat there all day \u2013 all shade and no sand! And the room was the closest to the actual beach we\u2019ve ever stayed. Walk from the room to the beach was like 30 seconds. If you love endless walks on your choice of beach or concrete path, this is the place for you. We loved how quiet the place was, things were clean and I always felt very safe even at night. When I walked all the way to the neighboring resort Barcelo **Palace**, it got more party-like with a college crowd and on one day, it was just like spring break, but just one day. The pool was wonderful. The food was very good. The buffet had like a gazillion choices. If instead you want to eat in the order-off-the-menu restaurants in the evening, make your reservations for every night as soon as you get there, or better yet, reserve before you even fly there, or you may be shut out of your choices at the times you want to go. There were something like a dozen restaurants, and we\u2019d recommend all but La Brisa and Coral Seafood (both fine for breakfast/lunch buffets, just not dinner). Kyoto Japanese restaurant was an absolute BLAST with the masterful hibachi chef and yucking it up with other couples. We went to the water park; it was small, cute, and fun, but if you don\u2019t go, don\u2019t worry that you\u2019ve missed too much. Don\u2019t worry that it\u2019s any kind of hassle if they tell you to take the \u201cshuttle\u201d to any of the restaurants. First of all we\u2019re walkers so walking a half mile to a restaurant within the resort was only a pleasure, so we often didn\u2019t take said \u201cshuttle,\u201d which is just a low, open-air trolley that\u2019s fun and easy to ride and you just go wait for the next one whenever you need it. We also went kayaking and paddleboarding and all this stuff is included in the all-inclusive price. However we paid a guy just over the border of the resort to take us on a speedboat over to the natural pool; that was $70 for two people for an hour and well worth it. Now let\u2019s talk booze. That was pretty hit or miss. It\u2019s all inclusive and indeed, I did get the feeling that the booze was watered down about half the time, and drinks just don\u2019t taste like they\u2019re supposed to. We did have an absolutely excellent Caiprinha and Negroni. But, our particular reservation level came with a bottle of rum in the room so we just drank that if we wanted more booze. Love how they handle the beach towels \u2013 they\u2019re in your room and that\u2019s where you bring them back to every evening; if you want to trade them out then you can do that, but this is such a great savings of resources over places that wash them every single day when it\u2019s not necessary. The maid service was good; they do often knock on your door even after 9:30 pm asking if you need towels or anything else and give you little pieces of chocolate. Kind of nice I guess but if you find that too late, maybe put the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on your door before going to bed. Also, when you first arrive, make sure they tag all your suitcases; we had four and the bellhop was only going to bring two of them to our room before I ran back and got the other two. And when we arrived they said we were premium level and told us to go to another area to check in for that, and we were waiting forever before we realized we arrived at 1:30 pm and check-in wasn\u2019t until 3 pm. They really should have told us that was the reason for the hold-up! Sometimes it was a little tricky communicating with the mostly Spanish-speaking staff, but not a big problem by any means. Brushing up the Spanish skills would definitely help! Weather was fantastic. I\u2019m a big fan of super-hot-and-humid Aruba so it was sometimes a little cool for my taste, but I would be in a huge minority there. And it\u2019s certainly cheaper than Aruba. I would absolutely come stay here in a heartbeat all over again and hope to do so."]},

The train runs about every 10 minutes. In the Palace, there is a Casino, Nightclub, bowling, shopping, and other restaurants. The other areas of the resorts have kids, and there is a nice families only section.", "I found the staff to be friendly and energetic overall; however, their customer service could have been better. Our first night, we requested towels THREE times before we finally received them. We went to a restaurant our FIRST night, and we didn't have reservations because Guest Services never got back to us (and it is ALWAYS crowded). I understand quite a bit of Spanish, and the host/hostess and servers were talking crap about us and definitely made it known they were not happy we had no reservation. I have been to Mexico four times, and the customer service there truly wants you to have the most wonderful time, and they cater to you. I didn't find the same level in DR. On the flip side, when we left, my husband left his passport in our room. We realized when we got to the airport, and one of the Vacacciones Barcelo staff helped call the resort. The resort did find it in our room and got a taxi to bring it to us at the airport. There's good, bad, and ugly, I suppose. Also, majority of the staff speaks and understands English well. Housekeeping didn't appear to understand or speak any English. ", "The bar by the pool is open until 10PM. The bar in the lobby is open until 12AM.

You only get new towels if you leave the others on the floor. Our shower was not cleaned, and we had no towels in the room.

Just don't lose your towels.", "The water pressure was HORRIBLE. I never felt like I could get really cleaned because it was like showering while someone is spitting on you. And, the water either scalded you or turned you to ice. It was really, really frustrating to have no water pressure. ", "FOOD:", "There are three restaurants in the Adults Only Section. There are 5 restaurants that are included in your All Inclusive. There are additional restaurants that have an upcharge of $15 or $30 depending which one you pick. Any restaurant that turns into an A La Carte for dinner requires reservations. Reservations must be made prior to 6PM with Guest Services. For the most part, reservation time was a non issue for us if you go to the larger restaurants like Santa Fe or Coral (in the Palace). On our last night we went to Chez Gourmet (Adults Only), and it is much smaller, so the reservation time must be followed.", "Caribe in Adults Only side (Buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner) - Food here was ok, nothing special, nothing worth noting. ", "La Brisa in Adults Only side (Buffet for lunch, A La Carte for Dinner) - The dinner here was ok. It was at this restaurant where the staff was unpleasant because we did not have a reservation. The food was blah. We got lobster, and it was mushy almost because they let it sit in a garlic sauce. The lunch buffet was much much better here than at Caribe. ", "Santa Fe in Palace Side - We went for dinner. It is definitely chaotic because it's large, and the servers are running around like crazy. I found the food to be good. No seasoning, so ask for sauce!", "Coral in Palace Side - We went for dinner. I found this restaurant to be more chaotic than Santa Fe, and the service took a while. Again, food is plain - ask for sauce!", "Chez Gourmet in Adults Only side - BEST restaurant we went to. We went for dinner on our last night. It was here we were actually offered house wine (which is included in All Inclusive). Every other restaurant gave a wine list to buy bottles. The food was enjoyable. It was seasoned, and there was a good variety to choose from. It's a nice setting for a last night in paradise."]},

We were told by some who frequent the area that it is not the norm, but can happen between May-September during hurricane season.  The staff effort in cleanup, although a losing battle, could have been better.  They used hand rakes and a few guys that clearly weren't motivated.  At times we wanted to grab the rake and show them how much more they could clean up if they added some effort.  No, the job is not the most glamorous, but it is a job.

{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Waste of money"], "content": ["My wife and I went here for a week on our anniversary. I can honestly say I will never return. There were SEVERAL issues here. First and foremost, the amount of aggressive sales people is ridiculous. If you have ever been on a cruise, and gotten off at port when the people all approach you and will NEVER leave you alone, then you know what I mean. This resort not only has those people on their beach, but they let people on their resort!!! My wife and I were so uncomfortable we tried to book a flight back home on day two. We got approached FOUR times just in the time we got there our first day (four hours). People would step in front of you and keep selling and selling until you got rude with them. People would come up to you in the pool, on the beach, walking around, EVERYWHERE. As much as I paid to go here, I would expect the resort to respect my space. Another issue we had was that they have multiple places to eat, but they are only open certain days, but they don't tell you what days. The beach was COVERED in sea weed, and they made minimal effort to clean it. We spent every day in the pool because of this. I spoke with a German excursion lady, and she shared with me that the Americans pay more and tip more on things. What was weird was that everyone had different colored bracelets. We tried to think of why this was, and I think that they do it based on where you are from. People would come up to me and say \"U.S, when did you get here\". The things is that I hadn't said anything to indicate this. So, I started talking to other people to test this. All the Americans had the same color. We met people from the U.K, they had a different color bracelet, and they said they had no issue with people bothering them. The other Americans (about 10 that we spoke to) said they would never return because of this same issue. Granted, the resort will never admit it, but they appear to have a rigged system here for making money. This place is a cheap joke for a resort."]},

They replaced the shower head but still no pressure. So a 15 min shower took us 1/2 hour. That\u2019s ok I can live with that. Our room was 2217 it was close to pool beach and restaurants.

There was a lot of figuring out on our own that was done from what restaurants served what, how to handle food allergies, etc. The staff were definitely helpful when asked, but I would say about half of them did not seem they enjoyed being there and it showed. We did have a problem with bugs flying around our room constantly as the cleaning service leaves the door wide open when working. This led to 20 bites on my ankles and a lot of itching :)  We had our 7 month old daughter with us and that staff was awesome with her and made us feel very welcoming.

You can eat a la carte meals every evening from a selection of four restaurants but they aren't always open.  Doesn't matter though because we liked the food at all four of them.  We never had to line up for anything.  There is a restaurant by the beach that has a coffee machine that makes all the fancy coffees. Also serves breakfast and lunch so you can eat there or take it with you back to your lounging chair.  No saving chairs rule is strictly enforced so you don't have to get up at the crack of dawn to save your chair.  Our room 5210 was also great.  It was on the third floor and you could see the ocean and the pool.  ", "Cons-The pool is only open from 9am to 7pm.  Not sure why.  There aren't any life guards on duty anyways.  If you like early morning lane swims you have to wait til 9. The red and white wine was not very good.  Not sure if \"ocean view\" was totally worth the upgrade as we would have liked to be closer to the ocean and farther away from the pool but that wasn't possible.  Ask for building 5 on the 3rd floor as it is the closest to the ocean.  The entertainment crew did their best but we didn't care too much for it.  The Michael Jackson show was our favourite.  The restaurant close to the beach is open all night long and they play the music there.  Would have been nice to leave our patio door open to listen to the waves but we heard the music instead so we closed it again.  Lots of peddlers on the beach.

The trip to and from the resort went smoothly, as did check-in.  We had been told our room would have an ocean view, but you could only see a small part of it by going onto the balcony and looking to the right.  The rooms were clean and spacious, as was the bathroom.  Maid service was excellent.  However, after the first day our a/c didn't work so well. We had the thermostat turned as low as it would go, but it was uncomfortably warm.  Even after maintenance came to fix it, they never really did.  The TV would come on at full volume at around 5 am on several nights.  Sometimes we couldn't turn it on at all, and maintenance would have to fix it. (Several of our friends reported this same problem.)  ", "    The breakfast buffet was a disappointment.  Much of the food was deep fried.  I never saw link or patty sausage, just hot dogs and more hot dogs.  The orange juice was sugary sweet, like Tang.  Definitely not real orange juice.  There weren't even boiled potatoes, just deep fried potato cakes. The pancakes were good, as were the scrambled eggs.  We never ate lunch or dinner in the buffet, since there were so many restaurants in the resort.  The only one that took reservations was the Japanese.  That meal was pretty good.  The other restaurants were first come, first served.  We would get there at around 5:30 (they start seating at 6:00).  We never had too long to wait since we were early.  The steakhouse (El Dorado, I believe) was close by so we ate there the most.  But we found the steaks to be quite tough and grisly. The chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it.  One night I ordered grouper, which was all right but didn't have much flavor.  The best restaurant was Italian.  We all enjoyed that meal.", "    There were several pools.  Of course, we used the one next to our room in building 3000. There seemed to be enough lounge chairs for everyone.  The bars (all of them) were well stocked with top shelf booze, though you had to ask for it, or you'd get the bar rail stuff.  The only beer I saw in the bars was Presidente, though the mini fridges in our rooms also had Budweiser.  There is a pool called The Secret Pool where we went one day.  It's on the resort map but is kind of hidden away and is for adults only.  It was a very nice pool with its own bar.  It had covered beds and the deck chairs were heavily padded for added comfort.  I'd recommend this pool for adults without kids.", "    There are little trains/trolleys that scoot all over the place, since the resort is so big.  You can ride these for free anytime. There is also a theater which, when we were there, had some great music.  One night we went, not knowing what to expect, and they a trio of tenors that were as good as the Canadian Tenors.  The various lounges also provided some good music in the evenings.  ", "    So there is a mix of positive and negative at this resort.  Some other negatives:  there is a real language barrier.  Most of the employees spoke very little, if any, English.  There didn't seem to be any effort at providing entertainment around the pool.  At the Riu resorts, there were always contests and fun things to get the guests involved.  I didn't see that here.  The employees, whether bartenders, waiters, entertainment staff or whatever, didn't seem to be enthusiastic at all. One couple in our group showed us their shower, where water from the floor above was streaming through the light fixture above the shower, apparently from an overflowing Jacuzzi.  It's a wonder nobody was electrocuted.  One last thing - there were no elevators in building 3000. You had to use the stairs.  I don't know if there are elevators in any of the other buildings.", "   Taking it all in, the best I can rate this resort is a 3.  I doubt we'll ever be back."]},
{"hotel": ["Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["I would not return to this resort!!!"], "content": ["My review is not all negative, it is hard to find a beach as beautiful as the ones in the DR, this resort is also very pretty and very clean!! ", "However, I would never ever go back to this resort or recommend it to others. The food is not good- there are a few dishes that are worth it at the buffets but otherwise it\u2019s far from what you are paying for. Some of the restaurants that are open for dinner have decent food, but you have to wait one to two hours every night to get into them. I was also sick for the last 3 days of this trip with stomach issues from the food. (Don\u2019t forget your pepto-bismo!!) I\u2019m assuming because nothing is kept cold- the meats, cheeses, creams- all warm. The very worst part of this resort is that EVERYTHING you do- EVERY TIME you move- someone is trying to sell you something. You can\u2019t even sit in your pool chair without people standing over you trying to get you to go on excursions or go to coco bongo. It is awful and not relaxing at all. I met up with people who said on the second day of their trip they had their cellphone on the charger in their room and when room service came to clean the cell was taken. They reported it and were told that they shouldn\u2019t have left it where it could get taken- so I suggest locking EVERYTHING in your safe!!! When you first get there you are greeted by someone from their TRS resort (the adult only section that you pay more money for- get to use a few extra restaurants and they have their own adult-only pool) the TRS person tells you that you have to go to a breakfast with them on one of your mornings at the resort- SAY NO! Unless you want to waste THREE HOURS of your morning trying to be talked into a timeshare for $25K. Everyone I talked to staying on the resort said that everything seems like a scam on this resort, including that breakfast. Luckily, I said no to the breakfast, but when I did- I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong. I was told by my representative that I was being rude because I wasn\u2019t helping him out with his \u201cpoints\u201d so that he could go to school, he acted very angry and told me that it wasn\u2019t a timeshare and how could I turn down a \u201cfree breakfast\u201d (I ate \u201cfree\u201d breakfast every morning though? We are on an all inclusive resort!!). Then my representative didn\u2019t speak to us for the entire rest of our stay, therefore, we had to figure out our transportation reservation time back to their airport on our own because he refused to help! This resort is also huge, so plan on walking ALOT, anywhere you go to dinner will take you quite a while to walk there, it\u2019s extremely exhausting after spending all day in the sun, I wouldn\u2019t stay at one this big or this spread out again. Needless to say, DON\u2019T STAY HERE!!!"]},

Both of them deserve SIGNIFICANT raises and promotions!  My only complaint is the hotel\u2019s partership wirh Vaccaciones Barcelo. Rijo lied to us about what our dune buggy excursion would entail. Instead it was a trip where we were pressured into buying cigars or alcohol. I will never book another excursion with that company.

{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["AMAZING staff"], "content": ["Spent a full week here with my husband and another couple at the end of May. When we first arrived, we were a little worried because it is a VERY small, laid back resort. After just 1 day, the amazing Jose and Sexy Rosy on the Animation team had nicknames for us (Cunyadoooo) and we were family from that day on. Nelson and the lovely ladies at the pool bar were amazing every single day. Glennys was our favorite resort waitress. We kept seeing her at random places and she not only remembered us, but hugged us and brought us Mama Juana :) The dance parties at the beach bar were so much fun. We were lucky to have 3 scheduled for the week we were there. The food was great! Only problem was, of the 4 restaurants, 1 was closed every night, so it was very limited. We did go to the sister resort for dinner 1 night to mix it up. You need reservations for those and they were extremely limited, but when we got there, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. They need to re-think that process for sure. The rooms were great. We were in building 4 and overlooked the pool. It was quiet and comfy. Only thing I would change is to add a door or a wall in the bathroom because once you get out of the shower, you are just out there for everyone else in your room to see. The only reason the resort did not get 5 stars was because there was no night life activity. Once the nightly show was over, there was no music, no people, nothing. Just dead silence by 11:30pm. There is a beach bar that is open 24/7, but almost every night we were the only people there and it was just quiet and awkward so we called it a night. The sister resort does have a night club open from 11pm-5am, but after midnight, you have to pay for your drinks. This is our 5th all inclusive and I have NEVER seen that before. Regardless of that, we WILL be back again. We have never repeated a resort, but this one felt like home!"]},

Staff is friendly and accommodating. Beach is beautiful and we had little trouble getting spots under umbrellas at the beach. Usually getting out there about 11:00 AM. There are vendors about but they are friendly and not especially aggressive. The folks in the front row at the beach will get hit up more so we stayed back a row. The staff appreciates tips so bring plenty of US dollars and a few fives for you favorite bar tenders. Food is above average for a hotel. We found the main buffet to be surprisingly our favorite. We are adventurous eaters so we would have eaten Dominican cuisine most of the trip. There usually was something unique and local available if you looked closely. We dined twice at the ala carte restaurants and it was nice service but not high end cuisine. On Dominican night at the main buffet they set up local vendors on the northern pathway and they were the only vendors we found annoying but you can avoid them simply by taking the southern path. The bar next to the beach restaurant was always nice for a after dinner drink. We also had a full moon during our trip which added to that view. And we made a habit of happy hour in the beautiful lobby which had the best bar. We stayed on premise except for on the excursion and this plus the trip from the airport led us to decide not to go off for dinner one night as car trips out can take while and there are so many speed bumps."]},

We were very happy with our stay. As other reviewers have said, this is a smaller adults-only resort: quiet and laid back. It\u2019s clean, beds are great, water is hot and food is good. Very quick, easy check in and check out. We\u2019re beach people as opposed to pool. It\u2019s very quiet and relaxed on the beach side; the pool seemed to draw groups / multiple couples: not rowdy but it certainly seemed a friendly, interactive spot. Food was good. We tried the Mexican and Italian restaurants and were pleased with both. Both of us had the steak at the Mexican and we were extremely happy: I\u2019d say the best steak at a resort I\u2019ve ever had. Buffet had theme nights and we were particularly pleased with the food on Dominican night.  The Mare Nostrum restaurant by the beach was convenient for a quick lunchtime snack but with a more limited menu than the buffet. Beach-bar was readily accessible and the staff made the rounds to deliver drinks as well. We had access to the sister resorts but didn\u2019t feel the need to go there.", "Overall, the staff is very friendly, service oriented and accommodating; lots of smiles, etc. Also obvious that a lot of guests had visited this resort multiple times: with hugs & kisses from the staff. I\u2019d say average age of the guests was probably 50s; certainly lots of younger 30s-40s couples as well as people like us in our 60s. ", "Bottom line: excellent value for the $; (hence my 5 rating). Nothing really to \u2018complain\u2019 about, however, we would suggest that the chairs on the room balconies need to be upgraded from the standard, uncomfortable white plastic deck chairs that are provided. As others have said, in places the resort could use a bit of an upgrade with paint touch ups here and there, etc. Did this impact our stay? Absolutely not. We\u2019ll definitely return again."]},

I was told upon checkin that a la carte restaurants were all booked the next 2 days unless we wanted dinner at 9:00 pm.  I was told 3 different things by Paradisus staff regarding restaurant reservations; talk about giving you the run around.  I ended up having the buffet which was hamburgers and hotdogs with a limited selection of sides. This alone is reason enough not to stay here. One of the main reasons my family and I like to vacation is to dine and enjoy good food. I was in a terrible mood due to this our first day. My family and I had been excited about this trip for months and ended up very disappointed. I don\u2019t know why people review this place and say the grounds are beautiful, they are just okay. The rooms are dated. The pool area may be impressive if you are a simple minded 22 year old that likes to listen to loud \u201ctop 40\u201d music, real spring break style. Not a luxurious feel to it by any means. To top it off, there were no towels at the pool and the safe in the room didn\u2019t work. There were no clear instructions on how to use it. Come to think of it, there was no real clarity regarding many aspects of this resort. Even when you walk into the buffet restaurants, nobody greets you. Customer service is lacking.

We called the front desk about 3x a day, I was beginning to wonder if it was a joke. But it wasn't. It's not that the room was in rough shape - it was - but it was the lack of ownership by the people working there to fix it and make it right.

Upon arrival I immediately felt at home. Check in was very quick and we were greeted with drinks. In the room there was even a bottle of Brugal (rum) and 3 cigars. The room was beautiful!!! It was immaculately clean and the temperature was good and can be adjusted to your liking. The bathroom was nice and adorned with flowers. My only complaint about the room is the mattress is a bit hard and the pillows flat but I got used to it and they provide enough pillows for you to pile on top of each other. When you get to the beach or the pool (or anywhere really) there is always someone offering a drink and they keep the drinks coming!!!! Not sure what other reviewers were saying about the drinks being bad/making them sick. You have the option to upgrade to VIP and get a \u201cbetter\u201d liquor selection but we didn\u2019t do that and the drinks still tasted great. All of the restaurants were delicious.

I\u2019ve never been anywhere with such amazing customer service from the ENTIRE staff. Anywhere we went or passed them in the resort they greeted us and made sure we were enjoying ourselves.

Yes they can be pushy but just assertively tell them you aren\u2019t interested and they will leave you alone. It\u2019s not annoying nor does it spoil the stay as some stated in other reviews.

We booked a regular room online, when we got there we decided to upgrade. They did not have a room to upgrade us but sold us the upgrade at a smaller rate with the condition that we would stay in the regular room but would be treated as an upgrade. We paid $150 dollars less. The room was old, smelled like mold, we got in the jacuzzi and parts started falling out into the tub. The upgrade was not worth the money. No one knows you\u2019re a VIP because no on e is wearing bracelets or anything else to let the staff know. The service on the beach was slow so we ended up spending most of our time at the pool.

Also his manager Simon, they made sure we had everything we wanted during our meals. Other amazing employees we loved were: Anthony and Elis  from the main pool,  Richard from the Grill.

I was able to set my expectations and get to understand  (through other people's experiences) what this resort was all about. ", "NOTE FOR MANAGEMENT: When travellers go to a resort, they DO NOT want to be bothered by any sales people (time shares or excursions). Every resort I have stayed at, has designated sections for selling excursions ( lobby bar). I really did NOT like the approach that you have implemented to your sales personnel. I felt bad every time I did not want to purchase an excursion and quite frankly I am on vacation and not there to feel bad. Please revise this approach. I spoke to other travellers who also found it bothersome. ", "PROS:", "- Easy Check-In and Check-Out process", "- Good food: beach buffet, Portofino, La Paisana, El Dorado - there were more restaurants but these were the closest to our building", "- Clean and updated accommodation", "- Well kept grounds, lush and tropical atmosphere", "- Large beach ", "CONS: ", "- Too many sales people - selling time shares and excursions. ", "- Assigned concierge is really only there to sell time shares. Upon checkin the staff introduce you to your 'concierge' who invites you to a 'welcome breakfast'. It was unclear at first what we were agreeing to but  after reading other reviews, I learned that this was only to sell time shares. The day of our 'welcome breakfast' we decided not to go and when we returned to our room a hotel staff was waiting to take us. We had to thank him and let him know we were not interested. 10 minutes later, another staff member returned to our room and insisted that we attend. It wasn't easy to get rid of him, he was too persistent. Another 10 minutes later we get a phone call, we assumed it was another a phone call to sign us up for the welcome breakfast. This was VERY annoying. ", "- Sales staff on resort grounds trying to sell excursions. From the time you leave breakfast to the late afternoon, if you are walking around the resort there are LOTS of sales people trying to sell excursions. I've stayed at Club Med and Paradisus in Punta Cana and this was never the case. This was also very annoying. I was not looking to do an excursion, we traveled with our 1.5 year old and did not want to leave the grounds. ", "- Had to go to the doctor's office for my daughter and I definitely felt there was a scam going on. We were referred to the hospital for an ear infection and an ear wash. We ended up not having to get an ear wash as you cannot give this to toddlers. Anyway, I found this out when I returned home. Not impressed, but I should have listened to my gut. ", "Overall: I would return only IF the sales strategy has changed. If not, I plan on going back to Club Med and/or Paradisus where this did not occur."]},
{"hotel": ["Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Meh"], "content": ["Overall was it a fun trip to Punta Cana? Yes. Would I choose this resort if I went back again? Probably not. Let me start with the positives.... the Bartenders are great! We kept going back to our favorite bartender Stanley on a daily basis because he was so wonderful. I can\u2019t say enough about how nice and fun he was and he did a great job keeping our drinks full all day at the pool. He needs a raise!! The rest of the staff was very friendly and personable as well. I know all the reviews say this place is HUGE but after the first day we found it fairly easy to navigate and the beach is close, pools and restaurants are everywhere and they have several trams cycling around so you don\u2019t have to walk.However, we were surprised at how many vendors were inside the actual resort and not just on the beach. We couldn\u2019t get to the lobby or the pool without someone trying to sell us cigars or jewelry. We also got several phone calls EVERY morning to come on our \u201cVIP breakfast tour\u201d that others have mentioned - I read reviews prior stating not to go so we kept having to unplug our phone at night so they\u2019d stop waking us up. I also really enjoyed my vacationexpress rep Jose who was available to us while we were there.     ", "Now for the negatives... immediately upon checkin the room was humid and the bellboy stayed the electricity to our room goes off when we leave the room so it may take a minute to cool off. It did not cool off... it was liveable but I don\u2019t think it ever went below 73 degrees. We also had difficulty with housekeeping. After the first night we stripped the bed and placed linens in the bathtub as suggested and when we came back we only had sheets, no comforter/bedspread. We called the front desk and they said they\u2019d bring one right over. We also asked for hand soap as our room had none. No one ever came. We slept with only a top sheet which wasn\u2019t a huge deal since it was warm in there but I have difficult sleeping  without the weight of a blanket. So we called our rep the next day and he made sure we got a blanket. A few days later, we left the room around 11 to hit the beach and turned the sign to green to let the maids know they could go in. We got back from the beach around 4pm and our room was untouched. We had plates from room service the night before that really needed taking out so we called and they said they\u2019d send someone immediately as maid service ends at 5pm. We left the room to grab a snack and came back at 5 and the room HAD been entered, but only to restock the minibar. THAT WAS IT?! At this point I\u2019m getting pretty upset so I go to the front desk and tell them I\u2019m not leaving until they get someone in to clean our room because our bed had already been stripped. After about an hour they finally assured me our room was being cleaned so I went back. BUT GUESS WHAT?! We had NO BLANKET on the bed again. So I spent another hour and a half at the front desk either multiple people and supervisors assuring me \u201cthey\u2019ll send someone\u201d. I said no, I am not leaving until it\u2019s done because this had already happened before and they never sent anyone. So overall I spent about 3 hours arguing with hotel staff that evening, not a pleasant experience. From that point on, we just didn\u2019t order room service or let the maids in the room. And to top it off, on the last night we killed a monster cockroach in the bathroom. I saw other reviews stating there\u2019s roaches but I hoped the problem was taken care of and took a chance by staying here. Nope, killed a roach. ", "The food was just okay at the buffets, portions small at a la carte, resort was dimly lit at night, only one option for the sports bar for food after 11pm which is in a corner of the resort and could be far from your room. Gift shop is way overpriced (sunscreen was $33). We rarely had a fully set table at the buffet and had to ask for silverware, glasses, etc. after we started eating. The excursions were fantastic! Don\u2019t drink the water, there\u2019s really no need to leave the resort except with your excursions but it looked safe during the daytime.", "5 STARS FOR STANLEY THE BARTENDER!"]},

I travel a lot and was brought up in a family that worked in the tourism industry.  I cannot figure out the 5 star reviews on Tripadvisor other than I believe a lot of people are enamored by the staff, who are wonderful and make the place.  However, the hotel itself is very average.  I am going to break it down.", "1.  Arrival:  We had no issues with check-in.  Right to our room and bags delivered within 15 minutes.", "2.  Room:   Let's be honest, folks.  The room was sub-par.  There was a distinct smell of mildew throughout the room.  The blankets were very old.  Parts of the fixtures were rotting.  The shower was mildewy and it was not sparkly clean.  Our refrigerator did not work the entire time - it froze everything, no matter what setting you put it on.  We drank room temperature water.  The sliding glass door would stick and it was hard to open and close.  Apparently, we got a room with newer beds, but the beds were still very firm.  There was a \"film\" on everything.  There are 2 fixtures - lol.  Bring a surge protector.", "3.  Can you say TOWEL GAME?  OMG - you had to get up at 6AM to get a front Palapa on the beach.  The same people get up prior to 6 everday to reserve their \"special\" spots by the pool and the beach.  We set our alarms and got down there by 6:30 to get a decent spot and then had breakfast.  You have to play the game.  One day we decided to go to the pool and there were NO spots. I have never seen the game played like this at any other resort.  ", "4.  Vendors - you will be approached.  Not just by vendors but by Animation Team and Spa employees as well.  They are very pushy.  I went into the spa to inquire about a massage and the woman wanted me to commit that day.  She saw me later and chased me down at the pool.  I decided not to get a massage at all - the pushiness turned me off big time.", "5.  Food - Food was good.  Dominican Night was very good.  Be careful walking into the restaurant on Domincan Night.  There are vendors set up along the walkway and they are pushy.  I always went to the grill station for a fresh omelette in the morning and grilled chicken in the evening.  Salads are fresh, and there is an abundance of choices.  We tried the Italian restaurant - I liked it and the Tex Mex - not as good.  The desserts were great.  My friend and I put on a few pounds.  Oh - and the coffee is great!  I miss the Domincan Coffee.", "6.  Beach and Pool - Beach is lovely but you will not get a view unless you get down there early in the morning to reserve a Palapa with a view.  The Palapas are very close together and most obstruct the view of the ocean.  Pool is nice but again, people reserve their spots early.  If you like activity, stay at the pool.  Animation Team is there in the afternoon and there is plenty of drinking and entertainment.", "7.  Shopping - yes the staff follow you around the shop.  They hover around you.  We just smiled at them and continued shopping.", "8.  Staff - Outstanding!  Raysa is the best employee of the lot.  I made sure I searched her out and gave her a tip before we left.  She is the hostess and you will know her.  she is always happy and singing.  The staff makes the resort.", "Overall, a nice trip and we got what we paid for.  Lower you expectations a bit.  We still had a lovely time and I expected to get less quality for less money.  I just did not expect all these people to write 5 star reviews.

We stayed at higher class resorts the last two years then this.  I try to keep that In mind while writing the review.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and hd a great time.  I will explain what we liked and didn\u2019t in depth and also some things we noticed that are not really the resorts fault.  ", "The lobby is large and spacious.  Check in was very quick and painless and with our later arrival no waiting on a room.  First room was twin beds but a quick trip to the front solved this.  The view was of a back alley and neighboring property.  We knew not to expect ocean view but still worst view we have had.  By the end of the stay we realized this helped keep the noise down in our room being in the back corner of the building from guests walking late at night.  The room is plenty large with a fold out couch and a king bed.  A jacuzzi tub is in the room and a very large nice shower.  Few downsides to our room.  Hotel uses occupancy sensors to save on electricity.  Even the alarm clock!  So it reset every time we left.  Out jacuzzi had the slowest flow of water ever.  Took over 30 minutes to fill.  The shower has a rainfall head and a detachable wand.  Out selector was broken.  The selection in the mini fridge was not very good.  3 or 4 sodas and 2 beers.  They did a ok job replacing them but only come once a day.  We only got wash rags twice the whole trip.  They never have them when cleaning in the morning and the second time they came by at 9pm to deliver them.  ", "The grounds of the resort are clean and well kept.  This is one of the quietest resorts we have ever stayed at.  Even at the pool and beach.  We enjoyed it.  The pool is very large and spacious.  The beach is large with plenty of chairs.  One thing that really isn\u2019t the resorts fault is the other hotel guests seem way to lazy to clean up after themselves.  Empty cups and trash everywhere.  There are trash cans everywhere.  It\u2019s not that hard to get out of the pool and throw away your own.  The resort may need to have more help cleaning up.  Now a major downer for us but not for all.  A huge portion of the guests seemed to be smokers.  We are non smokers and it was hard to get away from.  And once again they throw all their butts everywhere.  Even with ash trays everywhere.  So walking on the gorgeous beach and stepping on butts.  Lounge on the beach and every few minutes get drafted by someone else\u2019s smoke.  Also only one time did anyone come out and ask about drinks at even the vip section.  ", "The restaurants.  They have 4 main ones and the main buffet.  We got to try the tex mex and the Italian.  We used the buffet often.  Almost all the food we ate was good.  Some of the buffets did get repetitive.  The fajitas at the tex mex were awesome.  Italian was very good.  Also you can make reservations at the restaurants next door at the caribe.  See the front desk at least a day in advance.  I\u2019d do it as soon as you arrive.  Take the shuttle over.  We ate at their Asian which was good.  Also tried the Brazilian.  I was not super impressed there.  Main downside to the restaurants was we could find no posted days each one was closed.  We went to try to go to Italian one night and it was closed.  Most resorts add this info onto their welcome flyer.  I will say I am a picky eater but never had a problem finding food I liked.  The bars are plentiful.  Never to far.  I don\u2019t drink alchohol so I can\u2019t say how strong or good most are.  My wife enjoyed all the ones she had.  I love how they are not stingy with bottles of water like some resorts.  I was able to drink plenty and lay off the soda.  ", "The staff at this resort was very good.  Our favorite server was Israel.  They are all very friendly but most speak basic English.  Most seemed to speak 3 to 4 languages enough to get by.  They do make the resort.  ", "Overall we would come back for the right price.  I do have a few suggestions that would make this resort great!  ", "1.  WiFi is only available in the lobby.  It sucks.  Even when the lobby is not packed you can\u2019t get to emails or scroll Facebook or FaceTime easily.  I would be willing to pay more for them to upgrade WiFi.  Or have premium resort wide for a few.  We did end up enjoying not dealing with the phones most of the trip but it made it hard to check on the kids.  ", "2.  The beds and pillows.  Worst beds we have had at a all inclusive.  I would pack a pillow if you want anything but flat.  The beds could really use replacement.  Ours had a spring sticking out.  ", "3.  Request or educate guests to clean up after themselves.  It\u2019s a shame adults need to be told this.  ", "4.  Be prepared for vendors.  Most were easy to turn down but they were everywhere.  Someone else in our resort was offered heroin walking on the beach in the evening.  ", "So if you read this far good job!  If you find a good deal on this hotel and the few things I mentioned down scare you book!  I would go again for the right price.  The beach here is amazing.  "]},

We are still basking in the afterglow of both the resort and the friendliness of the staff. We are frequent travellers to the D.R., this being our 23rd visit to that island paradise and we can say with certainty that this was the best yet. This is not to denigrate any of our other visits as we have never had a bad vacation in the D.R. We have one resort that, until this trip, was our destination of choice and we had been there 8 times. However, what made the P.C. Princess special is the staff. It started at check-in and continued from there. The front desk staff was very accomodating and welcoming. Our every request was tended to immediately. One minor complaint was the size of the washroom in the room and as my wife has serious mobility issues she had difficulty getting around in there. A request for a room with an accessible washroom was granted immediately and we were moved the next day. Unfortunately, my wife fell on our 2nd day and the staff could not have been more helpful. No serious injury resulted but the staff watched over her like hawks, ensuring that she had no further episodes. In particular, Jasmine spoke to her every day to see how she was doing and inquire if there was anything she could do to help. The entire animation staff were wonderful and the shows they performed were very entertaining. Emilio at the lobby bar is an experience unto himself and having gotten to know him over the 2 weeks I can atest to his love of his job and the people who visit this resort. The serving staff, starting with Reysa, Alexandra, Nancy, and Raoul made mealtimes very special. You were always greeted by one of them with a smile on their face and a song as they gave you a welcoming hug. This was not just true for us but we watched this with the majority of the visitors. They appeared to be truly happy that we had chosen their resort and their behaviour reflected that. The serving staff at the pool bar were like the rest of the staff; entertaining and a pleasure to interact with. The only complaint that I have about this resort is that during the busy time of the day at the pool bar they only have one server, who has to tend to both the pool and the topside guests. There were times when it may have taken 10 minutes to get a drink. There was a great variety of food, with a different theme night in the main buffet every night. There really was no need to go to any of the a la carte restaurants and we, therefore, only went to the buffet. We met friends there who had been to the a la carte restaurants and report a positive experience. We would definitely return to this resort again and plan to, as I said earleri the D.R. is our destination of choice."]},

So, the view was far from fabulous. However, the room itself was very spacious. The bed was larger than any I've ever slept in (and we have a king at home). It's like they pushed two queen sizes together. I didn't even know this existed, but it was a nice touch. ", "What we'd change:", "If you care about looking out your window and seeing the ocean, you should probably pay a premium to do so. I'd like to have known our view would be obstructed, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. My only real issue with the room is that they had limited mini-bar selection. You'd think you would be stuffed from all the food, but if you're swimming all day, you might want some Dominican chocolate while you wait for your significant other to get dressed. Or you might want some whiskey or rum in your soda. The fridge had 2 cans of beer, soda, water, and juice. I asked for them to stock it with other stuff, and that request was ignored.", "THE BEACH:", "What we liked:", "It's stunning. It's probably the clearest water I've ever seen. Sand is soft; and water is warm. You can stand waist deep and see your feet. You can see small fish, but otherwise not a lot of wildlife. My wife found a couple of urchins and a giant starfish. That's about it.", "We can't change this but:", "Zero shells. If you're into shelling, this might disappoint you. Also, there are a couple of floating structures that resorts use to dock other boats.  Those aren't picturesque. ", "They have dolphins in an enclosure out there too. Kind of sad, actually.", "What we wish Barcelo would change:", "If they had shade umbrellas on the beach, and would bring you drinks and food, it might be perfect.", "POOLS", "We spent most of our time at the Adult pool. It's great. I wouldn't change much. If your ideal vacation is chilling by the pool and enjoying tropical drinks, This is a winner.  I would definitely recommend bringing a drink tumbler. The servers are totally fine with rinsing it out, and otherwise you ruin the planet with dozens of small (8 oz) plastic cups. I brought a massive one, and my drink stayed cold as long as I needed. Also, I tipped $1/drink (you should too), One annoying issue is you have to keep track of your towel. They will exchange a wet for a dry anytime, but if you lose it, it's $25. I have better things to do than to watch a towel. ;-)", "RESTAURANTS/BARS", "What we liked:", "Caribbean Buffet was nice for breakfast and lunch. Crepes with Nutella and cooked bananas is a winner. They have an omelet bar, which was decent. Lunch has freshly grilled seafood to order, and every dessert you could think of. If you like buffets, you'll probably like this one.", "La Brisa was a surprising dinner option. Food was decent, but I really liked that it was right off the beach. that breeze in the evening was memorable. White chocolate soup was my favorite dessert there, but food overall wasn't particularly memorable.", " ", "What we'd change:", "A lot, actually. The food is generally good, but not great. Chez Gourmet is probably the best one, and it's fine but I couldn't tell you anything that I had that was amazing. That was probably the best service, as there are 2-3 servers per table. Not the case at other places.", "We went to Coral (meh) and Santa Fe Steakhouse (also nothing special). Those are both at the Bavaro Palace (main resort). There are other restaurants you can try for extra money. After dropping $3K on a vacation, I wasn't really excited to pay more for dinner...and on principle, it's a bit annoying. Last thing, if you want a quiet meal, avoid the main dining room at the Bavaro Palace. There are 100 worn out, sun-burned kids there. It is really loud, and not a great experience.", "Also, the alcohol...I'm not a snob about this stuff, but most resorts I've been to have the option of top shelf alcohol at all of their bars. I've not heard of most of the brands they had. Ron Barcelo is a pretty good rum, and you should ask for it specifically at the pool bar. They only have Presidente beer, which is just okay (if you like PBR, you'll be fine). The lobby bar is stocked. You can get lots of selection there. Lastly, if you're into wine, you probably will NOT be pleased with the house selection at any of the restaurants. It's their white or red blend, or you pay a premium for bottles. We really didn't like that.", "SHOWS:", "We really enjoyed the Michael Jackson show (I was really surprsed). Also, the acrobatic show was impressive. They do a great job of engaging the audience and getting people on their feet. It's like a party every night.", "SERVICE:", "What we liked:", "Everyone smiled, and you can tell that they really want to do the best they can for you.", "What we'd change:", "A few times, \"the best\" wasn't good enough. Again, trying not to be a snob here, but if you're used to the service you might get in Mexico, BVI/UVI, or Jamaica, you need to reset your expectations. The wait staff needs to be trained to be more attentive to little things (e.g. water glass/coffee cup bone dry for 5+ minutes, no place settings, etc.). I know, I know, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but if you've been in the Caribbean sun for 2 hours, you just want some water. All I'm saying is, we definitely noticed this.", "Also, I'm not sure if this is just related to Barcelo or to DR in general, but I got the impression that the staff is not empowered to do what they need to to quickly resolve an issue. For example, wifi was included as part of our room package. There was some kind of mix-up, and they couldn't find it in their records. We had it on our receipt. Anywhere else, this is case-closed. If you paid for it and can show you've paid for it, you get it...end of conversation. It took them 3 managers and over 30 minutes to resolve our problem. That didn't feel welcoming.", "PRO TIP:", "If you arrive early, unless you do the premium level, your room probably won't be ready. The resort amenities are still available to you. I walked around the resort with a hot, heavy backpack for 2 hours until we stumbled upon a guest locker room (it's right across from guest services). When I asked about it, they said it was available. This is what I mean by \"being attentive.\" That should have been mentioned when we arrived. SO, when YOU get there, and they tell you that you can use the resort while your room is getting ready, tell them you'd like a locker, and get into a swim suit! :-)", "Have fun!"]},

There will always be some kinds of issues or wonderment as to why a place does or doesn't do certain things and this place is no different in that it had a few quirks, but overall it was really, really beautiful and the staff were all friendly and work very hard. We spent mornings down at the beach (yes, because I'm picky about where I sit, I did go down and save chairs in the front row of the beach), but we were there very early and then gave up our seats at lunch time to happy guests when we went to eat and then go to the pool for the afternoon.  Chairs can always be had at the beach and the pool and we were there when it was sold out.  We met some great folks there who I had connected with on the hotel facebook page before going and we hit it off so much that we plan to meet up again.  ", "All of the food was good and we did not get sick one single time the entire trip which is a record, we have always gotten sick at least briefly in Mexico.  We were very careful to use the bottled water that they provide to brush our teeth.  The breakfast buffet is generally the same each day, including omelettes. We only ate in main buffet for this, but available also at the beach restaurant. Dinner buffet varies based on \"theme\" - Italian, Asian, etc. We went to the steak house/Tex Mex twice which had awesome chicken fajitas and I hear they just updated menu further.  The Italian was great as well, those two are next to each other and seem to alternate being closed based on buffet type - i.e. if its Italian night, the Italian is closed, makes sense.  The fondue was a slight disappointment, the shrimp was great, but the meat seemed strange for whatever reason there and we ended up leaving before dessert, but we were full anyway, we had lunch at Mare Nostrum, but never dinner when it converts to seafood restaurant. We ate at LaCava, sister hotel next door as well, which was included in our package but did require reservations made in advance.  The dinner was great and we opted to purchase a bottle of wine over the house wine.   ", "We booked a honeymoon suite and included in the package was a bottle of rum, cigars, we got a nice fruit basket, a romantic massage by the beach which was nice, 2 other massages that I didn't end up doing, but I did also purchase a pedicure for about $30 at the spa located in the front of the sister resort and it was great. Very relaxing additions to our trip. The honeymoon suite that we received was 4205 and it was absolutely awesome!  2 floors with the jacuzzi tub and small table upstairs with a 2nd balcony.  There was an issue with hot water a few times and maintenance came in to \"fix\" the shower handle, one time when we came back, there was no water at all because they were swapping out the pumps or something, but I think it was just bad timing on our part, we just dealt with it and went to buffet instead of restaurant, but others in my building said it was on within minutes, not a big deal.  The maid service was always consistent and excellent, she always came while we were out, so it was like magic.  The scariest issue we had was upon check in when the front desk welcomed us and said that we were upgraded to VIP at the Barvarro Princess.... I was like, um, no.... we want to stay here, I booked a honeymoon suite here, so no thank you.  It was all a polite exchange and I let them know that it's fine if our room was not ready yet because we knew we were early and had our bathing suits ready, we had no problem waiting for the real check in time or later.  Ultimately, the Expedia rep (who I booked through) came over and we had a nice drink and bracelet to go eat and then come back at 3pm.  No problem.  Came back, they said you are all set, we'll take your luggage to your room and we were brought to the most unbelievable room that I just started laughing.  Here I'm thinking we're going to be now jerked around and put in a dungeon and I honestly think we may have gotten the nicest room in the place instead.  Hugs for everyone!  ", "During the time we were there, there was a large group of folks from Canada including people that played several times in a band by the pool, in the lobby and on the beach who were great.  ", "We will definitely be back again soon and will bring friends!  We never tried Casino, others said it was not worth going, never went to theatre or disco.  Gives me even more reason to go back to do the things I didn't get to!  This is the perfect place to unwind and casually forget what day it is.  Animation team does a nice job but lots of people don't want to participate.  There was a foam pool party the day before we left and it was super fun, they should do that once a week.  One thing I would suggest is a schedule in advance for foam pool party and the shows because it was hard to know when to book a tour if you wanted to see a certain show or not miss the beach party, etc.  The live band at the swim up bar area was great and I hope they continue to provide that kind of entertainment and energy.  Thanks for a great trip!"]},

Most of the food served was what we have at our home for Dominican themed parties so it was perfect. Kudos to you all for this. We appreciate it. ", "The food is outstanding! We love the Italian restaurant and the carnival buffet that always has tons of Dominican food- rice, beans, stews, roasted meats as well as a grill where you can get custom grilled meats, a pasta station and Pizza is always there for the kids who are picky and a kids corner.

Think I overdosed on mangoes.", "Here are some minor notes for management-", "WiFi", "this was much worse this time- lots of areas with no service- you need a full hotel WiFi solution.

Also there is a black cord running from 1 and 2 to the security hut- it needs to be buried before someone gets hurt.", "Thanks for taking our comments about Oasis last time seriously. The cooler never smelled thanks to Alheny (Angel) and Luis. ", "The hotel needs to make a location change is Oasis 1 and 2 or change the beach cleaning staging area. There was a lot of seaweed being cleaned which is much appreciated and Now takes great pride in keeping the beach super clean. But the issue is that the staging area for the multiple trucks and piles of seaweed is in front of Oasis 1 and 2. Mgt needs to move the Oasis 1 and 2 closer to 3 and 4 or change the truck staging area since this issue is ongoing. Also the view is completely obstructed by seaweed and trucks which isn\u2019t great since preferred guests pay for a private beach and the oasis users pay even more for use of that space. I heard this might be in the works and I really hope it happens. ", "Other than that- zero complaints! We will be back in August or sooner."]},

Read on to find out!", "CHECK-IN", "Our check-in experience was mostly positive. We arrived 4 hours early, therefore we didn\u2019t expect our room to be ready. We left our bags with the bellhop and proceeded to the front desk to get our bracelets. The staff was courteous and friendly, providing us with recommendations for lunch. ", "Following a nice lunch at Naos, we returned to the lobby to fetch our room keys. Our room was even ready a tad earlier than expected. ", "OUR ROOM", "We booked a \u201cregular room\u201d near the pool. The room was actually larger than we expected with a nice split-level design. The bed was located on the upper portion of the room, with a small staircase leading to a comfortable sitting area. The room was equipped with all the usual amenities, including a safe and a small refrigerator which was stocked with beer, soft drinks, and water on a daily basis. There are also patio doors that lead to a beautiful veranda with two chairs and a nice table - perfect for late day drinks!", "The king-sized bed was very comfortable - in fact, I would rate it above average. The room came with a flat-screen TV - but we never actually turned it on. We don\u2019t come to the Dominican Republic to watch TV - besides, there\u2019s so much to do at this resort, who has time for TV!", "Housekeeping services were timely and always excellent. We always came back to a freshly cleaned and re-supplied room at the end of the day.", "The air conditioning is also very good - in fact, we had to turn the thermostat up a few degrees as we sometimes found the room too cold.", "Our only complaint would be that the room could benefit from stronger water pressure. Not a big issue, but it took longer than necessary to take a shower. Otherwise, our accommodations surprised us on the upside. For a standard room, it was much bigger than we expected.", "TIP:", "If possible, try to get an end-unit room - it has the benefit of a side window which provides additional sunlight.", "THE RESORT", "Our first observation is how beautiful this resort is. For those of you who may have stayed at either the Melia Tropical or Caribe, you already know of how beautiful the gardens are at Melia properties. But this resort takes the concept of tropical landscaping to the next level. It is a botanical wonderland.", "The grounds are extremely lush and perfectly manicured. We particularly enjoyed walking the path between the lobby and the rooms at night - the trees along the path are lit in an absolutely enchanting fashion. If you enjoy leisurely evening walks after dinner - this resort is for you!", "We should also mention how much we appreciated the electric vehicles. They really help cut down on the noise pollution, which in turn makes for a nicer vacation experience. It\u2019s nice to be able to listen to the birds while enjoying late day drinks on our terrace.", "Another nice touch is a small library where you can exchange your books for new ones should you run out of reading material.

I'm not sure if smoking is banned, but at the very least, it's not encouraged. It's nice to be able to enjoy a smoke-free holiday when going to restaurants and bars - well done Melia!", "In terms of size, the resort is about half the size of the Melia Caribe. We enjoyed the smaller size as everything at the resort is within a convenient walking distance. It almost has a boutique hotel feel, while offering all the benefits of a larger resort. In short, it strikes a perfect balance.", "The resort is also very safe and clean. We always felt secure walking throughout the resort, both during the day and at night. We should also mention that there are very few bugs and mosquitos after sundown - therefore, their pest-control measures are working well.", "RESTAURANTS", "Simply said, this is the best food experience we\u2019ve ever had at an all-inclusive resort in twenty years. Both the buffet and fine dining restaurants offer a rich selection of foods that are sure to please even the most finicky palate.", "NAOS and the GABI", "The smaller of the two buffet restaurants, it was our go-to destination for breakfast. It\u2019s also where you want to head to at night for a late evening hamburger.", "Like the larger GABI buffet restaurant, the food selection at NAOS was outstanding. The variety and freshness of the food was much better than what we\u2019ve experienced in recent years at other resorts.

Strongly recommended.", "ONE FINAL NOTE", "We unfortunately didn\u2019t have a chance to visit all of the restaurants at the resort. Friends we travelled with did dine at VENTO and report that like the other restaurants at the resort, the service and food quality were impeccable.", "We should also mention that it was sometimes difficult to make dinner reservations over the phone. Extra staff might be needed to help alleviate that problem.", "If food and dining are important considerations when choosing a resort, the Paradisus will not disappoint. In fact, it might very well be one of the better resorts in terms of food quality and selection.", "BARS", "We attended 7 different bars during our stay, receiving timely and friendly service at each one. Drinks choices were plentiful, and never watered-down. Bartenders often surprised us with special cocktails that added a nice element of surprise to our daily consumption.", "We must make special mention of Juan Bautista - the bartender at the Sunrise bar on the beach. At the beginning of our trip, I mentioned to him that I had to keep the sugar content in my drinks to a minimum. For the duration of our 14 day stay, Juan remembered my preference and always prepared my drinks in a low-sugar manner. That\u2019s incredible customer service.", "I should also thank the staff from the M-Bar for keeping us so entertained, night after night. Saymon, Oscar, Arigl, Bibeluin, Yaritzia - your hard work is appreciated (sorry if I misspelled any of your names - did the best I could).", "THE BEACH AND POOL EXPERIENCE", "The stretch of beach surrounding the resort is amongst the most beautiful in Punta Cana. If you enjoy long walks/runs on the beach, you won\u2019t be disappointed. Sea grass and sargassum levels were minimal (mind you, that is very much a variable and seasonal thing) and the beachfront is very well maintained. ", "The waves at this end of the beach are more pronounced than what we are used to. At that\u2019s not a bad thing. It made swimming in the ocean lots of fun, but it never became too challenging. The resort\u2019s ocean frontage is essentially one large sandbar, so you can walk out quite a ways and still be in comfortably shallow waters, while not having to deal with any seaweed beds. Overall, a great ocean and beach experience.", "We should mention that the service at the Royal Service section of the beach was outstanding. Staff offered to setup our chairs, fetched towels for us, brought us drinks and snacks...what else could we ask for!", "THE POOL", "The main pool at the resort was simply breathtaking. So lush and tropical, with a pool bar that featured surprisingly fast service. There are plenty of huts around the periphery of the pool, so shady spots are always easy to find. Fresh towels are plentiful and can be found at the activity hut next to the washrooms.", "The service level at the pool was also impressive. Even while pondering our chair/hut selection, staff would approach and offer to bring us towels.", "Pool activities were also lots of fun - we especially enjoyed the Tuesday foam party. ", "ENTERTAINMENT", "Yes, there are scheduled shows in a beautiful theater setting at the lobby, but we\u2019ve seen most of them over the years, so we prefer to roam the resort after dinner in search of entertainment - and there\u2019s lots of it to be found. ", "We discovered dance parties on the beach, foam parties in the pool and an amazing display of opera singing in the lobby. So much variety! Even the bartenders at the M-Bar offer an element of entertainment while they work.", "When it comes to nightlife, the resort offers a nice balance that caters to many different demographics. Well done!", "CONCLUSION", "Over twenty years, we\u2019ve experienced many wonderful holidays at multiple Melia Resorts in Punta Cana. Each of their resorts caters to a unique demographic, with amenities suited to different vacation styles. ", "The Melia Tropical is a great adults-only choice for couples, whereas the Melia Caribe is more family-focused with features such as a water park.", "The Paradisus is unique in its own right. It\u2019s a smaller property with more of a boutique hotel feel. It\u2019s also a more refined vacation experience in terms of both service and dining options. We found that it struck a nice balance for a couple in their mid-fifties.", "We can give this resort our fullest recommendation.

However, we watched over the 2 weeks and a lot of men were in the restaurants with their open shoes. Not a consistent rule. ", "Towel Game- Most people play the towel game. Putting towels on loungers to save their spots. This year security would move the towels, but not all. Just randomly take the towels away.

Unless you pay for premium wine or liquor, you will spend this all inclusive vacation pretty much sober. All the drinks were watered down. On to the rooms, I could never get the room to go below 24 C or about 74.  The air conditioning system was inadequate and would shut off whenever you left the room. Showers were often cold water.   Also found the harassment in the lobby from the \"Circle Club\" to be off putting. Dinner reservations were hard to make and often were told that they were full.  Had to eat at 6 or 930 to get into most restaurants.  Lastly, was watching live music on the beach with my 3 year old at 630 pm and tried to sit on some vacant  beach chairs.  A attendant came over and told me the chairs were only for rent.  Had to squat in the sand holding my son for 15 minutes so he could enjoy the music.  Paradisus Punta Cana has taken the al a cart airline pricing to heart.  Very disappointed in the property and would never return. They seem to cater to the \"Reserve\" which is the same property but higher prices.  That's fine but they need to make that clear. It was obvious when ordering at the bar as the bartender would look at the color of your wristband before pouring drinks. I would suggest looking elsewhere for your vacation or at least compare the \"reserve\" price against your other resort options.

I do have one major complaint that will keep me from returning but that will be in a further down. ", "We did upgrade to Xhale and the room was nice but it was not worth the extra cost.  I did enjoy the a la cart lunch for xhale only.  I ordered a ribeye for lunch several times.  They did not restock the snacks in our room.  The xhale lounge was nice and a good place for a drink.  In fact not once did anyone ask to see our Xhale card so I\u2019m thinking anyone could go there.  ", "The food was hit or miss.  Breakfast was good and room service was quick and easy. We went to the steak place first night and food was amazing.  Went again on night 4 and it was average at best. Steak was thick the first time and very thin the second time for same meal. Hibachi was ok. They Didn\u2019t take any custom orders like other all inclusive see have visited.  Everyone was served the same over cooked meat and food.  Typically I would have wanted more seafood vs other protein.  But enjoyable and entertaining for sure.  Overall good but not amazing. ", "The beach was beautiful and they worked to keep it clean. Definitely head to tropical treasures to the north 100 yards for a massage.  So amazing and way cheaper than the resort.  The beach attendants were all lovely, prompt and happy.  Thank you George!", " The larger pool had lots of chairs and shade at all times, but we only went to the party pool not the main pool.  It is smaller and there was the towel game, but we were never in the seats so it was not a problem for us.  It was very lively and fun. Lots of shenanigans for sure and a good party.   Music was as expected for a party pool. Kelvin at the swim up bar was happy and worked is butt off.  Always a pleasant smile.  The glow party at night in the pool is not to be missed.   So fun!  Ladies.  Whatever you want to wear or not wear is ok and fun.  Our butler said all pools were topless optional for those that are curious.  ", "Now, my problem is small but important to me.  I drink whiskey, specifically Crown Royal. I hate scotch.  I always look and research ahead to make sure they have Crown Royal. It was in most every menu, not just xhale.  I ordered my crown and water and watched them pour it out of a crown bottle, but it was definitely not crown royal.  It was some really crappy scotch... nothing good at all.  This happened at every bar and every restaurant on the resort. (Yes even the Xhale Lounge). I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not just crown but other liquor as well.   It just makes me mad that they try to pass it off as the real thing.   Eventually after enough complaining they \u201cfound\u201d a new bottle and it was the real thing.  The bar tenders would hide it and only serve it to us.  It makes me sad because there are so many good things about this resort.   I\u2019ve been to many all inclusive (higher end) and have never had this.  Maybe a little water but not a complete switch like this.  I can\u2019t say other liquors are the same, but can\u2019t imagine they aren\u2019t.  Many times they were \u201cout\u201d of crown.  GO GET MORE!  For them to be so cheap on this is just sad for an amazing place.  It\u2019s all inclusive and you say you offer something and then don\u2019t. Very disappointing and a bait and switch. But, if you are not particular or want frozen drinks made from who knows what then you will be fine.  And I refuse to bring liquor to an all inclusive that states they will have what I want.

{"hotel": ["Grand Palladium Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Bad experience Would never come back"], "content": ["We booked through Apple Vacations, I am not a fan. They did not give us much information about the flight, all we knew was zi eland air and show up at the airport your plane leaves at 6:30 am. Not confirmation #, no check in before the flight. Upon arrival in Punta Cana your typical foreign airport customs etc. Gather baggage which is just all line up, go through immigration to go through the long exit area looking for a rep of Apple vacations for our transfer to the hotel. Pretty much had no clue where to find them or what they would be wearing. Finally spot them for transport to the hotel. Arriving at the hotel we were greeted by people with cool faceclothes. They could not locate our check in paperwork as we were booked with Apple and an apple rep was not there at the moment. They took our passports to make photo copies, I find odd, hopefully no one steels our identity.  On our way to our room. We are in a room near one of the pools which seems great however if you want to sleep in late, it is impossible. The blaring poolside music comes on at 7 am. The hallways are noisy  and doors slam hard. Our room had  king size bed and a sleeper sofa, which we needed for our daughter. No extra pilows, sheets or blankets, which we did not realize the first evening until it was very late and did not want to wait up any long for some e to bring them. Speaking of pillows 2 are supper soft the other 2 are rock hard. Very uncomfortable.  I awoke the first night several times to the ac turning on every 30 seconds or so, but then at some point it shuts off and you sweet your butt off. Then in the morning I realized there was a smell of smoke in the room, it smelled like trash burning.   This goes on everynight and only during the night, the burning smell is not around during the daylight. There is a tin our room which turns on but cannot figure out how to get the channels to work.  The tub /shower in our room is rather odd. There is a frosted sliding glass door whoch opens to the room. In the bathroom itself it has just a half door not frosted so there is no privacy. There is a shower wand and a rainfall shower, if you use the shower wand it tends to spray outside the shower. The water in the shower is only luke warm not hot. The water in the tub drains very slowly so you are standing in your dirty water while showering. The step up over the tb wall is very high.  Entertainment at our pool is probably the best thing this resort has going for them.  The entertainers are fun. The drinks sometimes taste ok and other times they are nasty tasting.  Beverages near the pol come in hard plastic cups, sometimes with a straw other times no straws, the glasses are small, bring a refillable cup with you. The food is disgusting. The best meal we had was at the Japanese  hibachi grill. The Argentina  steakhouse was not good, not a fan of the Mexican food. I would highely suggest to stsy away from the burgers, not sure what kindvof meat it is . I also received raw lamb and chicken at the beach BBQ.I in general do not like buffet, but you at least get a variety of the worse and best(which is limited) food they have to offer. Some of the food is labeled at the buffet, while most is not. If you have food allergies or a picky eater you may have a difficult time.  All around the resort and the beach you are constantly  being approached by sales people. People trying to get you to go on excursions, buy timeshares, buy their goods, have your hair braided and more. The disco is open until 2am and the sports bar people returning can be very loud in the hallways.  This is very annoying. I would not recommend  this resort And would never return."]},

My favorites were the first three \u00e0 la cartes but the buffet was just as good with a good variety and different theme every night. Food is good and staff is great. I usually like to provide names of staff that stood out but here the list would be too large. They were all great. From the restaurants to the bars, the personnel were the best.

At the time we waited instead of giving us a quick walk through of how to make restaurant reservations, booking activities, help us get around since is such a big Facility and greeting us a welcoming way. He instead talked about when can we meet eat breakfast and make sure we talk to him because he doesnt get pay and needs to make a commission with us.

In one day at least 5 people that did not work in the facility walked around trying to sell you overprice excursions, by invading your personal space and wasting your time.  BE CAREFUL!! I felt like we couldnt even enjoy the beach or pool without tranquility and privacy. This is one of the most dissapointing thing about the resort. It\u2019s crazy how this one effected us so much. The travel club agent, Victor Pena, came over when we checked in and harass you the ENTIRE trip. We had to avoid certain walk ways and take extra time to get places so they wouldn\u2019t talk to us.

From what I've heard, the Impressive Resort and Spa had just opened its doors in January 2019. I was previously a Sunscape resort. I've never travelled to a Sunscape in the past so I'm not entirely sure how much updates were brought in. I understand that any new resorts will have kinks to work out but it looks like they may have reopened in haste. We do not normally travel during this time of year, often preferring the fall when schools is back on and there aren't so many kids around or that many guests travelling during the low season.", "First things first, checkin:", "Checkin was fairly fast. We arrived a little after 4 with another small group. I had all the intentions of upgrading to the premium service on arrival based on other reviews from Facebook groups. We had made a request to be in the same building as the other couple we were travelling with. The request was emailed and confirmed by their concierge a week prior to our arrival but I guess that email was not found... when we asked where the 2 rooms would be located, they were entirely at different ends of the resort and they were not able to put us in the same building... UNTIL we asked for the premium upgrade. At the cost of $175 USD per rooms, we were able to get 2 rooms in building 24.", "Room:", "Hubby and I got room 24122 in building 24. Super close to the left side premium beach and premium pool. A little far from the main lobby and buffet but with a great view of the beach volleyball and beach from our terrace. On our arrival, our mini fridge was not stocked but a quick call to the front desk remedied the situation. Hubby and I like to have the room cleaned every other day. On the off days, we put up the \"Do not disturb\" sign. The room was always immaculate with plenty of towels. I always leave little make up gift pouches for the maid and on the last day, having seen it was the same lady, we gave her a cash tip. Nothing went missing, we even had some canadian dollars left on the dresser that was only moved when she cleaned the room. Only experienced a lack of hot water one 1 day - it wasn't totally cold, just lukewarm, really.", "Food:", "Food was hit and miss. They must have ran out of bacon on the 4th day for breakfast but there were enough other choices not to starve. Lots of fresh fruits and fresh mini croissants so I was happy. The freshly made-to-order omelette station was a hit with our group. Tid bit of advice if you're a coffee drinker, the coffee served at breakfast is more like mudwater. Order a cappuccino and you will be pleased. (Goes well with the Mimosas too!) The buffet food was OK in general. Always a variety of choices for all meals. Service was hit and miss. Drink orders and water was a tad disorganized. When often we would wait forever to get water and when ording mimosas or coffee, it would never come. Same for lunch and dinner service. I preferred the Olive Tree for lunch. We got great service there and the food was fantastic. Another advice, if you like a Rose, just ask for white wine and red wine mixed. Same thing'ish! ", "Restaurants:", "No reservations required at any restaurants, except the Japanese. Dress code was also very lax. Hubby was able to wear \"dressy\" shorts at all of them. There was also a great little coffee shop by the reception area when you could get anything from cappuccinos to ice coffees.", "Hotel Grounds:", "Very nice overall. I liked the jungle feel with mature palm trees and shrubs all over. Lots of workers and gardeners constantly working at keeping the gardens and grounds immaculate. Buildings were kept clean.", "Beach:", "SUPER BUSY. I wish there were some palapas though. At some times during the day, the sun was really hot and there was no shade to be found. A bit disappointed that a lot of people were reserving seats all day and not claiming them. The Premium beach was a mess... such a small area for so many people! And non-premium guests taking chairs, even the Bali beds! (I will get to that further in my review.)", "Pool:", "We hung out at the premium pool most of our stay. The main pool again had no chairs available. The water was a tad cold but refreshing. ", "Lobby / Theatre:", "The lobby area was the place to be at night. There was a live band/singer every night. I hope management thinks about relocating this. There was never a place to sit to enjoy the shows or to just hang out. The dancing area was also tiny. We've watched the show from afar on a couple occasions and they were nothing really to attract us to it. Definitely no big productions compared to other resorts we've been to.", "Premium Service:", "Now... this is the big question everyone seems to be asking... we did not book a premium suite. We decided to leave it to fate and purchase the upgrade on arrival. We paid $175 USD for our entire week stay. This gave us: A white bracelet, Free WiFi throughout the resort and grounds, access to premium alcohol, access to premium pool, access to premium beach. I think the resort oversold the premium service, which could be why the beach was sooo packed. Maybe this also gave us a better room, but I don't have a reference to compare to. Staff/Security also did not really enforce the premium bracelets at the pool or beach so I'm not sure if our $175 USD was well spent. Although, I did find that the brown premium beach towels were very plushy compared to the regular orange towels. Actual premium guests staying in the actual premium buildings had gold bracelets and non-premium guests had no bracelets at all. All and all... We found out that that WiFi for the week was between $30 to $40 USD - depending who you ask.", "All in all, we had great company so we made the best of it. I guess for a 4 stars, you can't really complain. We met some great people and made memories."]},

Only complaint is not enough shade for people who dont want to sit in the sun all day or families with children or seniors. Palapas would be a great thing for the beach at this resort.  I love being at the beach  because I love to swim in the ocean but couldn't stay in the sun all day without shade. Entertainment staff was great.  Rissa loves her job and always so funny very friendly and king Kong also very friendly. The lady bartender( sorry can't remember her name) at the main pool bar was amazing she was always coming around asking if we needed anything and such a sweet girl. The food at a la cartes not very good and buffet was hit or miss. I will return if more shade was added to the beach for those of us that love the ocean but need some shade.

Best vacation spot ever!"], "content": ["This is my families 5th time at this resort and we won\u2019t be stopping anytime soon. This isn\u2019t just some regular all inclusive hotel. It\u2019s a full nature experience. You can walk throughout this resort for hours and continue to find new places. If we\u2019re feeling lazy and we don\u2019t want to walk, you can catch a ride about every ten minutes from multiple stops they have. The pool bar is insanely fun for all ages and they do activities every single day. If you get a room in the reserve, you have access to the reserve pool and pool bar which is very relaxing, with lounge chairs IN THE POOL!! So you don\u2019t get too hot trying to catch a nice tan. The food is incredible there are so many options at all times for food between room service, the buffets and several restaurants. All of the staff here make the experience as amazing as it is. They treat you like royalty and care for you like family. They genuinely just want to see everyone having the best time while you\u2019re on vacation and it really does make the whole vacation something special. No matter who tends to you, I promise you will not be disappointed. This time around we were blessed to have Jhonatan Medina, Jairo minier, Ramon Jimenez, Naomi Mosso, Germania from the reserve pool, Jesus from the reserve pool, Wander and Ramon from the reserve beach, Anthony that took care of us for most of our trip in the reserve, Jose who took over for him when he went home, Jose from the regular lobby, marcelo from the pool bar.. the list goes on and on these are just the names I can remember!! I have never fallen so in love with a place/experience before, this is our forever vacation spot; our second home with our amazing Spanish family. Thank you paradisus for once again giving me the best week of my life."]},

I chose the Sheraton brand to grant myself and my boyfriend great quality in service, but that is not what I got. ", "We arrived at the hotel on Monday, and none of the 4 credit cards we presented in the reception would work (keep in mind that we had been travelling 10 days already and never had any issue of this kind, the hotel in Santo Domingo accepted our card right away). I was in possession of a 5th credit card which had reached the maximum expense for the month (it was the 30th of January) so I asked if it was possible to pay the room on the 1st of February. I was answered that they could not let me in the room without a deposit. This is not something I expect from a Sheraton: all hotels I stayed in had me pay at check out, and surely a Sheraton should be flexible about this. We offered to do a Bank transfer in front of them, but they refused because, as it was bank holiday, they would not be able to verify the transfer. They had us run around 3 different ATMs to be able to get enough cash to anticipate the first night in order to let us in. All this was done in an impolite way, treating us as thieves by a rude receptionist. ", "Finally, we reached our room and given the bank coordinates for the transfer of the remaining nights. However, these coordinates were incomplete (no SWIFT code) and it took us 2 days of back and forth with receptionists to make them give us the complete info (so much for \u201crelaxing on a beach\u201d).", "Last night of stay, thanks to all the advertisement in the hotel about the 'happy hour' at the hotel bar, we chose to go. The advertisement stated that from 5pm to 8pm, all beers and cocktails were at 50%. We happily ordered 4 cocktails of the house, the 'four points'. At the moment of the bill, we were asked to pay for the full amount (without considering the happy hour offer), when asked we were told that that specific cocktail was not part of the offer. We argued it was not marked anywhere and were not told at the moment of ordering. The bar manager told us they did not have to communicate anything and that he couldn't do anything about it as the cocktail was not included in the offer. We told that we were not willing to pay the whole amount as it was their fault for the misunderstanding, and the manager even threatened to call security. ", "Never in my life I have been treated as I have been treated in this hotel: they barely speak English, they are rude with guests and for the all staying you get the feeling that you are \u201cthe rich cash cow to be peeled of its money through any possible way\u201d. ", "To conclude, the cherry on top of the cake. I write to the Sheraton Customer Service to explain my problems, and they assure me they will start an investigation. 1 week later, having received no answer, I ask them if they have any news. They reply immediately forwarding me an email of the hotel where they describe me as an half thief/half liar, and CS conclude saying \u201cthis is the person who wrote this email, if you want you can contact her directly\u201d. ", "To sum it up: experience (local) = 0, customer care (international) = 0. No comment on Sheraton, other that I will avoid this chain for the rest of my life."]},

As we have our BATEAU.com certification, we were OK to go without any $$ concern.", "Ocean water was CLEAN and a bit cold.  I appreciated my short wet suit but my husband was perfectly OK to jump in the waves.  Some algae on the beach, which is cleaned every morning.

Bring your towels, WATER and most of all, dry clothes to come back.  The Bus is very confortable with good cool AC system.

I just want to state the worst part of our experience first. When we first arrived at 930 pm, we were tired and just wanted to rest in our room.  To say we found some millepedes in our room would be a gross understatement. The room was riddled with them. We had to complain but all they could do was send someone to clean it up because no rooms were available at that time (they promised to switch rooms for us in the morning). Even after the room had been cleaned, a few minutes later, more baby millepedes kept showing up. We did not sleep well that night. The experience got better the day afterwards and then on when we were switched rooms like promised. We got a nice room on the 3rd floor the only bugs we had to worry bout were mosquitos and sand fleas (outside of the room).

We purchased wifi for the room and that was still pretty unusable.

Wine was from Spain and equivalent to a French Beaujolais, and did not contain a high level of Alcohol.  Service in restaurants was very confusing, they had someone for water, someone to set tables, someone to serve drinks, someone to clear the tables, someone at the door to take the room # (not quite sure why) and a sommelier in some instances and more, very confusing.  There seems to have a shortage of glasses especially wine glasses.  Very limited service in the restaurants/buffets; the service was sometimes very good and at other times it was so poor that I felt like getting up to get my own coffee, water, beer or wine.  We went to the Japanese restaurant, and it was OK, not super fantastic \u2013 yes we did get a show from the cook but he was not the best \u2013 the food was OK, not impressive.

Although Cuba has some great beaches and resorts, nothing I've been to has it all like the Impressive has.", " The rooms were top notch. The beds were so comfortable and the bathrooms were awesome. We stayed in building 24 and  had a spectacular view of the quiet pool which was beautiful lit up at night as we sat on our balcony. Very quiet peaceful evenings we had here.", "The grounds were the most beautiful I've ever seen. Green grass everywhere and the most beautiful palm trees scattered all over this resort along with many beautiful flowering shrubs and plants. An absolute joy to walk around and take in the sights. Everything and everywhere we looked it was lush and outstanding. Hats off to all the grounds crew for an amazing atmosphere.", "The buffet for breakfast was right on the beach. So nice to start the day having a nice breakfast and look out over the water. Food was great. I'm vegetarian and never wanted for something to eat. Lots of delicious breads and fruits to chose from. Karen had an omelette every morning and never waited more than 5 minutes. ", "There is a snack bar by the beach that serves hot dogs, nachos and pizza. It is a self serve and we strolled of the beach most days at lunch to eat. Great quick option to have to get back to the beach.", "The main buffet was great too.We don't do the A la Carte's more because of my dietary needs as the main dishes are meat or fish etc...

The geotubes in the water that used to be scattered about looks like they have been moved offshore to form a wall to protect the beach from erosion. You can't really see them as they are quite a ways out there. Sand was like flour and water was just the right temperature to cool you off but never get chilled. I got to the beach every morning about 7:30 and had lots of chair options. The shade is provided by the tall palm trees that line the beach. Truelly a beautiful beach. The beach staff are constantly patrolling the beach with rakes and wheelbarrow and removing any seaweed that washes up. We walked the beache for miles in both directions and ours was by far the cleanest beach we saw. Hats off to the great staff. They deserve your tips.", "The Impressive Resort is the first resort I've been to that I would love to return too.

In general, the staff were not friendly - unless they thought they were going to get a tip (and we tipped many of them). I would say the exception was in the buffet restaurant, where they were very nice.  The bed in the room was so uncomfortable we both ended up with sore backs by the end of the trip, the shower leaked water all over the bathroom, and the shower grout was covered in mold. Also, the \"gym\" is very minimal and always over-crowded to the point where I would consider it unusable.

Special thank you to Raoul the Food Manager as well as to the waiters (young) Raoul, Grey, Nelson, Jose Samuel, Altagracia, Iris and to Jose from the Animation Team (such a kind energetic young man); his Michael Jackson show is amazing. For those of you who remember Jose, Manager at La Petite Fondue, I have great news for you, Jose is back at PCP and as always is very kind and goes out of his way to accommodate everyone.   The meals at supper time, whether it be at the specialty restaurants or at the buffet were exceptional. We had lobster and shrimps at the Italian, Dominican and Mexican Buffet which were all amazing.  The breakfast and lunch however are not as good as they used to be. I used to love their beach BBQ but have found their ribs to be tough and the corn under or over cooked on both days which used to be so delicious. They serve hash brown potatoes now and then at breakfast but should do so every morning (mashed or boiled potatoes for breakfast are not my favourite).  The premises from the beach area to the pool to the gardens are all very beautiful.  As previous mentioned, the lighting in the bedroom is really bad trying to put your make up on and there should definitely be a dresser with a few drawers in the room for additional storage.  However, the issue with the shower drain had been fixed in our room. The reception staff were also very kind and helpful. The Wifi, even though we purchased a package, was not always available throughout the resort. The cleaning lady was amazing. The Animation was so much fun; including the foam party which was amazing. In my opinion, Jose should always be talking to the crowd when using the microphone since he can be easily understood in English, French and Spanish, whereas Michelle is very hard to comprehend. Overall, we had an amazing stay. We still find the resort to be an amazing price value."]},

Food from the Lyn Crawford in-flight menu had to be specially requested from the flight attendant. Transfer through Customs and Immigration at Punta Cana airport was rapid, taking about 20 minutes.", "This was our eighth visit to PCP, so it felt like \u201ccoming home\u201d when we walked into the lobby, especially when the staff recognized us and called us by name.", "We had requested, via email to the PCP Guest Services, a specific room on the top-floor of building number 1. This request was based on the central placement of the building relative to lobby, pool and beach. The reason for wanting a top-floor room is that it has vaulted ceilings, making the room appear more spacious. Fortunately the requested room was available but due to our noon arrival was not ready for occupancy until 3 P.M..", "Our ongoing complaint about the rooms is their impracticality, i.e., extremely poor lighting over the bathroom vanity, no dresser or any other drawer space in the room, no mirror in the bedroom, and a ridiculous hot tub that we never used and probably was not used by 90% of guests. However, the room was spotlessly clean and was kept that way by the friendly housekeeping staff throughout our stay. Fresh flowers strewn about every day was a nice touch.", "A major change this year was the modernization and refurnishing of the lobby area. Gone are the wicker chairs and couches, grungy cushions and dark wood tables. Instead there are a number of comfortable lounging chairs, several mid-height, round drink tables and many comfortable chairs. Unfortunately, the Interior Designer went beyond practical with a number of large, 25 cm high steel tables and matching low chairs. However, this indiscretion was offset by a long bar-height table with comfortable wooden bar stools, a popular \u201cpeople meeting\u201d feature.", "NB. The tap water is not drinkable, but copious bottles of water are provided daily in the room fridge, in the bathroom and for the in-room coffee making bar. In previous years bottled water was available from all bars.

The beach is walkable for miles in both directions with resort properties fronting 90% of it. A large waterfront native marketplace is about 1 km. to the left (west) of the PCP.  This market was seriously affected by shoreline erosion over the past several years, but fortunately, has now been moved further back from the high-tide line making the vendor stalls much easier to access by beach walkers.

Every evening for dinner, there was a different \u201ctheme\u201d - Spanish, Italian, Asian, International, etc. with special dishes featured. On our previous visits to PCP, the buffet entrance displayed incredible & elaborate decorations for each theme night, but last year and this year they were conspicuously absent.

", "A-la-carte menus were available at four restaurants, Italian, Tex-Mex (steak, ribs, etc), Fondue (seafood, meat, chicken, etc., to be dipped/cooked in boiling oil at the table) and a Seafood place by the beach. Reservations were not required. On the one occasion when we attempted to enter the Italian restaurant with friends, we were refused entry as all the males had open toe sandals. The fact that the women were similarly attired did not seem significant. Also, the following night several men were admitted in shorts and sandals. On previous visits to the PCP the shorts, open toe shoe policy was never enforced. This policy, along with several others seemed to be very inconsistent this year.", "This year, as last year, we requested a preferred table at the main buffet, for both breakfast and dinner (creatures of habit I guess). The request was honoured with a reserved sign, flowers and a distinctive napkin arrangement on most occasions. The only exceptions were when a certain guest took umbrage at the preferential treatment and insisted on sitting at the table even though the dining room was virtually empty.  Not a problem!", "The wine at all the restaurants was palatable and enjoyable, especially the champagne.", "The staff were super-friendly at all the bars and restaurants, and were very appreciative of a dollar or two for their attentive service.", "The wait-staff were probably the most efficient and pleasant of any Caribbean resort we have visited, always trying to converse with guests with their limited knowledge of the guest\u2019s language - and they were always happy & singing.", "Unlike larger resorts, the PCP did not have a theatre for the evening shows; instead folding chairs were brought in and lined up theatre-style in the lobby where the entertainment was provided by the \u201cAnimation\u201d crew. The \u201cAnimation\u201d crew are noticeable throughout the resort all day, conducting various activities from aqua aerobics, pool games and beach exercise sessions.

However, we allow for the fact that we are visiting relatively underdeveloped countries and that expectations should be adjusted accordingly. Consequently, the PCP deserves it\u2019s 4 + star rating when judged by those criteria. We would most definitely make another return visit!", "I have refrained from selecting any staff members for special recognition as they are all fantastic and go out of their way to be friendly.

Definitely book any excursions that you are thinking of on your flight down and receive a 20% discount (at least we did, i do not know if the is standard procedure). The Punta Cana princess was a wonderful resort that I would highly recommend if you are wanting a relaxing vacation (if you are wanting loud and noisy and a party atmosphere, look somewhere else). I loved that the resort was not huge and it was well maintained. The staff were all very polite and helpful with a ready smile. The room was spacious for two and the maid service was quick and efficient. You might see some complaints that there is not much privacy with the bathrooms- there are glass doors on the toilet (frosted) and shower (clear) but  there is no door to close off the bathroom from the rest of the room. We had no issues with that- I can only imagine how musty the room might get if there was a bathroom door as the humidity in Punta Cana is quite high. Traveling with Sunwing, we found out that the VIP lounge beds on the beach were for Sunwing clients only- although you had to be on the beach early to get one reserved (before 8AM) or they all had towels on them- don't be disappointed as they are far less comfortable than they look and although they are covered, they did let in a fair bit of sun. We preferred the little huts as they were kind of secluded, kept out the sun and kept us from being pelted by sand on the windy days. On the beach, the sand is so soft and white and the water is the rich Caribbean blue.The meals were good and the buffet had a different theme each night for supper- I appreciated not having to make reservations. Punta Cana Princess is a wonderful resort to stay at."]},

Overall it was a lovely trip.  The resort is more intimate - I don't want to say small because that seems negative, so if you prefer not to get lost in the crown, nor deal with a lot of noise and craziness, this resort is perfect.  You see familiar faces every day and become fast friends and you don't need a trolley to get anywhere on the resort.  You are max a three minute walk from anything at any time.", "There is a good balance of quiet time and activities at the pool and the Animacion team is always there to encourage you to get involved but they don't pressure you if you don't want to.  The foam party in the pool is fun.  ", "The buffet was excellent, but naturally being a smaller resort the buffet was proportionate; however I found most of the food to be of excellent quality and there is always fresh meat and fish on the grill.  The chicken and fish were to-die-for.  There was a distinct absence of avocados but then I don't know if it's off season or if they just aren't native to the DR.  The mangoes, passion fruit, guava and pineapple were abundant and sent me on a little trip to heaven each time.", "As I was travelling with a friend, we didn't need the romantic jacuzzi in the room and found it just took up space for us, however if that's your thing, it's very nice.  The beds, as reported by many other travelers are firm but just fine.  The pillows are thin so ask for more if you need them.", "The layout of the room made the space seem small, although very interesting.  There is no dresser - just a closet and shelves, and we found the storage space to be inadequate despite both being light packers so our stuff was spread out around the room.  We considered adding a third person to our group and I'm glad we didn't because it would have been far too cramped.  But the room as clean, the linens fresh and the AC kept us cool at night.  ", "The small annoyances were 1) never enough coffee mate, 2) we only had facecloths two days, 3) the WiFi that we paid for was \"sort of\" connected. (It would say \"Connected, no internet\" which allowed us to surf certain apps but when linking to a web page or something it would say \"connection refused\".  It behaved as though there was no internet at all.  Regarding 1 and 2, we left a healthy tip every day and had asked for extra of these things the first few days but it didn't seem to stick.  Other travelers didn't have these issues.", "The other annoyance was the bottled water.  The lids are torqued on so tightly on some of the bottles we couldn't open them at all.  This became very frustrating and sent me home with a blister on one hand.  I'd recommend travelling with a grip cloth that you'd use in the kitchen to help this or a strong man.   We are strong but just couldn't do it!", "This being said, these are all \"first world problems\" and would not factor in my decision to return to the resort or not.  The staff are amazing and everyone wants you to have a great time!  Tonny (yes, with two Ns) in the Animacion team is hilarious and every day is his birthday.  Yosaira who serves in the buffet, at the pool and the beachside bar is a scream.  I loved her!  She loooooves you too!  Always there was an enthusiastic smile, laugh and kiss on the cheek.", "We ate at the Italian and Tex Mex a la Carte restaurants and very much enjoyed both.  The Swiss was hit and miss.  The shrimp fondue we started with was delicious but the cheese fondue we had for dinner was not my cup of tea.  Much stronger flavour than I like and the cheese was grainy, versus the gooey texture that we typically like.  ", "Overall I'd recommend this resort and if you are looking for more action periodically, the sister resorts are right there.  You don't have to roll up the sidewalk at 9 pm if you don't want to.  :)"]},

I asked if the hotel had a mini-fridge and microwave.  I was told mini-fridge yes, microwave cost $10.  I arrived prepared to only use the mini fridge.  When I got there on Dec 31st, I was told there was a charge for the mini-fridge.  I told them about my question and the response.   It was recorded as one of the questions here on tripadvisor (see Q&A). the front desk staff didn't want to believe me.  I took my phone out and showed them the message from Leydi who had said there would be no charge... then they said I could have the mini-fridge only for this time. If you need a mini-fridge please use my message!", "Then we wanted to go to the beach.... well, it was closed.  Open only for people who paid an extra charge for a private party.  We wanted to go to the pool... well, it was also closed.  ", "The rooms had thin walls and we asked to be moved several times due to people screaming until well past 2 am. Thankfully, we had plans to go to Santo Domingo, and Saona Island for a few days.  Since we were going back to the hotel before we flew home, I asked for towels to take to the Island... the answer off course was no...

We made the request, knowing that (understandably) such a change might not be possible, but Elis pulled it out of her hat. She really made the difference between a good vacation and a spectacular one. We will definitely be back and will be bringing friends with us.

We had a fantastic time! We had upgraded to Diamond Club when we booked our trip, and feel it was worth it. ", "- Shuttle from airport to resort was smooth. We appreciated them waiting for us because the Immigration line was ridiculous. It seemed like every flight deplaned at the same time.", "- Diamond Club check in was very pleasant. The young lady who checked us in was very nice. You are greeted with a cocktail, and there are snacks (sweet & savoury), a variety of coffees and alcoholic drinks available while you wait. We had our first Presidente beer (Dominican water!) which we really liked! It is a very smooth beer. We received our resort bracelets that are equipped with a chip that allows you entry into your hotel room. This was handy so that our kids could come and go without worrying about losing room cards. We all had our own access right on our wrists. Afterwards we were introduced to our concierge/butler Edwin. He took us on a tour as we walked to our rooms. We were able to book any and all of our A La Carte restaurants with Edwin, which was very handy. We went to the Mexican restaurant twice and the Italian once. Both restaurants were very good. We especially enjoyed our fajitas, and the rice pudding!", "- A big thank you to Edwin for being patient with us and answering any questions we had!", "- Our room (in building 29) was spacious, with two comfortable queen sized beds, lots of drawer space, and a separate room for the safe and a walk in closet with lots of wooden hangers. The mini fridge was filled with a variety of pop, beer and water bottles. There were additional water bottles at the sink for teeth brushing, and for the coffee maker. It is not recommended to drink the tap water! Our room had a balcony overlooking the main Splash pool area. We were in the middle of the building. One end was next to the main buffet \"Selections\". The other end was close to the Water Park, and the roadway to the Royalton part of the resort, their plaza, gym and the beach. ", "- There were trolleys running around the resort very often. I don't think you needed to wait more than 10 minutes for one. However, the walk to the Royalton and beach area took us only 5-6 minutes to walk, and we often arrived at the Royalton entrance at the same time as the trolley! The walk was nice and there were many ducks and a black bird with a red top that looked like a small chicken that would waddle up to see if you had any handouts. They were very chill and would pop a squat right in the middle of the road. The trolley drivers were very cooperative about sharing the road with them and would drive around them if they didn't move.", "- The Splash pool area was fun, with fun activities with the Vibe team. Zumba with Gasolina was fun, and the Fram girl from France! I think her name was Lola. Very upbeat positive team member, and a friendly young lady!", "- There was never any trouble getting a pool lounger, except ones under the umbrellas or shady areas. Overall, it was not really an issue. The towel system is great. If you need one, get one, when you're done, toss it in the towel bin or return it. No silly towel card system. ", "- Staff would come around to clean up any empty cups and to take drink orders. Bar area was efficient, drinks were good. We mostly had Presidente beer, and water, but the pina coladas were great too! ", "- Free Wi-Fi throughout the resort and even the beach.", "- This is a very clean resort, with staff constantly around cleaning up and working in the garden. It was truly a lovely and clean resort.", "- The staff almost all speak English (really well), though Spanish is their main language. You will find quite a few people, moreso the vendors that come to the resort a few times a week, that also speak French. ", "- About the vendors, they were very friendly, but could be quite pushy. They were respectful if you said \"no gracias\" and kept walking, but they would be all over you if you only wanted to look at what they had. I think that kept us from purchasing things. One thing to keep in mind, if you show interest in something, but don't have cash on you, they will wrap it and bag it for you and tell you to take it to your room, they trust that you will return to pay for the item. They never even asked us for a name or room number. That was interesting. I didn't mind that for an item I did want to purchase, but the problem I have is that they tried to sell my 17 year old son a painting for $90usd, and gave it to him to take to his room. He felt very pressured and as a naive young guy, didn't know how to tell the guy he did not want to buy anything just yet. Fortunately, he texted us right away (we were at the beach nearby) while he was checking out the pool, and he was able to return the item and tell the guy he was not interested. The guy had the nerve to ask him if he could pay him at least $10usd for \"his trouble\"! What the ****?! Seriously?? That was a little much. Needless to say, don't feel guilty saying no thank you. You will get pressured heavily if you show interest in anything. (Check the prices in the shops to see what the vendor items are worth, and haggle accordingly.)", "- The main buffet has a good selection and variety of food. We had no trouble finding something to our liking. Everyone gets a pump of hand sanitizer when you check in, which I'm sure helps with germy hands touching all of the utensils in the buffet! I really enjoyed the crepes made by Francisco, in the morning! ", "- Regarding the buffet, the staff were quite good, however it sometimes took a long time to get a coffee in the morning, when you needed it most. Even after asking twice for it. ", "- As a Diamond Club member, you can have lunch at the Grazie buffet on the Royalton grounds, with a view of the beach. Food there was very good.", "- The beach area is sectioned off for Memories, Royalton and Diamond Club members. There was no trouble getting a lounger on the beach. Behind the DC beach area is the DC bar which served food items as well as drinks, and next to that was the quiet DC club pool. It was a great shady spot with very cool water that felt great on sunburnt skin! The beach was very nice, and the free water activities were easy to use. Wakeboards, kayaks, paddleboards etc. ", "- The waterpark was fun, and enjoyed by the kids. There is a smaller waterpark area for smaller kids, a wave pool, and the waterslides for the big kids. There were some slides where you could use single or double tubes, which were provided. The lifeguards were vigilant and kept things safe.", "- On the Splash side, there is a kid and teen club/entertainment area, where the kids can play ping pong, pool and games. In this area, you can also go to Beans cafe for a coffee and dessert, or to Bites for a burger/hot dog or fries.", "- At the Royalton plaza, you can catch a show in the theatre in the evening, or get a coffee, sandwich, ice cream or dessert at the Cafe Lounge/Scoops. A special thank you to Sadeica and the young lady who worked in the evenings! The cafe con leche and latte macchiatos were delicious! ", "- At Cafe Lounge/Scoops, there are 4 tubes that dispense toppings for the ice cream. The three tall ones had sliced almonds, walnuts and chocolate or white choc chips. There was one shorter tube that had gummy bears in it. I would stay away from that one. The grossest thing I saw on the first visit there, was a tourist who opened the lid and reached in with his bare hand and scooped a bunch of gummies out for their kid. He stuck his hand....into the container. Gross. What is wrong with some people?? The other 3 containers looked too tall for anyone to be able to do that without having to stand on a chair, so those looked safe. I guess the gummies got stuck in the dispenser part, but seriously, get a spoon or a cup or ask for help! Don't shove your germy hand into food!", "- The gym was fairly busy in the morning, and it was warm in there. It was better to go before 7:00am. There are weights and cardio equipment. Area was small, but people made it work and there was something for everyone. You can book time at one of three tennis courts, which was fun. The rackets looked new. You can also play badminton just outside the court area, except the ground is grassy and muddy in spots. The net is tied between two palm trees.", "- You can purchase inflatables for the pool, snacks, or souvenirs at the shops at either of the resorts. Inflatables were about $18usd. Sunscreen and After Sun gel was between $12-15usd.", "- Tipping is common around the resorts, and US dollars seemed preferred, though you could also tip in Dominican pesos. You didn't have to have your dollar bill on the counter to be served, like in some Mexican resorts. Here you were served first, and tips appeared appreciated.", "- Overall we had a great time at this resort and would recommend it to anyone. The staff were friendly and worked hard, it was clean and well kept. The rooms were clean and mini fridge stocked. We tipped each day.", "- 24-hr room service was pretty good. You could peruse the menu on your TV with the remote, and place your order. Most times service was really quick. One time an order was forgotten and it had to be re-ordered.", "- One minor CON would be the the crazy peacocks!  It was fun to see them perched above the balcony, but less fun when they were screaming to their peacock friends in the middle of the night and early in the morning. Go to sleep silly birds!!", "- A tip for your flight back. Don't bother to bring any resort sandwiches or food or snacks for the flight. The people at the airline counter and before Immigration (again?) said no food is allowed. If you have food, it has to go into your checked bag. This was confusing as we were allowed to bring food items and snacks for our flight from Canada. I understand that liquids are not allowed, but a granola bar, chips or other snack is not? After going through yet another lengthy immigration lineup, we barely had any time at all in the shops or food court at the airport. This was unfortunate as the shops looked varied and nice. So if you are interested in souvenirs, I would suggest getting it at the resort or before the airport, as you may not have time to do anything once you get there. We thought we would have plenty of time by leaving just over 3 hours ahead, but the shuttle stopped at several resorts to pick up other passengers, which used up a lot of time.", "In conclusion, we would recommend this resort, if you are looking for a stress free holiday to escape our brutal cold winters! Brush up on your Spanish and even some French, and have fun! Muchas gracias Grand Memories Splash!"]},

", "We were perplexed about the bathroom design. Even me a mid 30\u2019s male struggled at times to get in and out of the bathtub to shower, a very awkward and unnecessary process. The glazed sliding door which separates the bedroom from bathroom is a nice touch but we found that water leaks through onto the bedroom floor. Getting up for that late night toilet break is also an issue as turning on the bathroom light shines straight through the glass and wakes your partner up in bed.", "So our biggest disappointment by far was the food. This is the reason we have given the resort 3 stars. As a family we have a wide range of different tastes. We were happy about all the different A La Carte restaurants before arriving. The excitement unfortunately didn\u2019t last long as we had our first meal at the Asian restaurant (Bamboo). Probably the worst meal we had the entire holiday. We do not genuinely enjoy large portions but these were minimal. In order to serve small portions the food has to be excellent, it was far far from it. Mine seemed like it was rice from a packet and my wife\u2019s was similar.", "The second night we ate in the Indian restaurant. Again we were disappointed. The food was bland and not a great variety of choice.

This had a much better selection of meals.", "Mexican restaurant again was disappointing, limited choice and the food was barely warm when it reached us.", "You will struggle at times to flag a staff member down for water or to order drinks at the buffets.

As our child is young we aimed to get to the restaurant around 1745 local time which generally wasn\u2019t an issue but anytime after this, you can find yourself queuing for a long time waiting to be seated. The Japanese Teppanyaki bar was our favourite meal but you have to book this the day before, I suggest booking this no later than 0800 the day before as it\u2019s very popular.

Buffets are pretty much the same breakfast, lunch and dinner, the last two days I didn't even want to go eat the thought was grossing me out. There's a long time between breakfast and lunch that there's no food aside from the snack bar at the beach or long walk/shuttle at the sports bar (Bavaro side) The resort is huge, expect a lot of walking or uncomfortable shuttle rides. The bed is super hard, Building 3000 is all about loud staff and slamming doors. Bad room design, can't go to the washroom at night without lighting up the whole room. Our bar fridge seldom got replenished, we asked to get at least water after 10 pm one night, never received it...Snack bars are rare, no take out containers at buffets to bring food to the beach or the pool.

It was easy to find the transport at the airport. The ride to the resort was about 20 minutes. They immediately bring you a drink and a cold towel to cool off. The rooms were not ready right away as we got there before official check-in, so we just changed and went to the pool. There was a small snafu where the resort didn\u2019t have a room with a King bed for me and my wife, but they rectified thankfully because sleeping in a Queen would have required too much snuggling for us.", "By far the worst part of check-in and in general for this vacation was the in-your-face intense sales pitch from their Travel Club (aka Timeshare team). I am not saying the Travel Club is not a fun thing to do (as it turns out my buddy and his wife joined) its just not something we want to be hounded about while vacationing. These people swarm you to the point where you just find yourself getting snippy with them to leave you alone. In fairness, we experienced a similar thing when we traveled to Punta Cana at a different resort 4 years ago. For me it\u2019s a big turn off.", "PROPERTY LAYOUT", "The best way to understand this massive property is to know The Grand Palladium (GP) is 1 singular resort entity where EVERYONE can use essentially all amenities. There are a few VERY minor exceptions. Within this Resort are 4 specific zones. Each zone has its own lobby and features. The 1st zone being TRS (The Royalty Suites). From what I gathered these are the more luxurious rooms. There is also a certain level of exclusivity. For example, they have 1 restaurant for them and Travel Club Members only. They get some extra perks and no other guests are permitted in the TRS lobby area.", "Next to TRS is The Grand Palace Zone and adjacent is Punta Cana Resort, which is where we stayed. There is virtually no distinction in either. The Grand Palace was located near more shops and restaurants + the spa but Punta Cana Resort was closer to Kids program, etc. In my opinion both Punta Cana Resort and Grand Palace are the best and most centrally located zones to stay on site. Each has nice lobby areas and pools.", "The last zone is The Bavaro. This area seems to be the newest and have more rooms/ room styles/villas etc. but it\u2019s a bit of a hike. If you walk briskly you can get there in 10 minutes from Punta Cana zone, 15 minutes from Grand Palace zone and 20 minutes from TRS zone. Bavaro had a cool sports bar, a disco, a theater and a few restaurants.", "The way the property is laid out makes EVERY zone close to the beach area. Every room is a 5 minute or less walk to a beach and 5 minutes or less to one of the 5 pools. I was surprised to see so many people using the trams to travel around. GP offers a myriad of Golf Carts and Tram Rides to get you to where you need to go. Truthfully its only necessary if you are strolling kids or are up there in age. Take the time on your first day to learn your way around. Especially the short cuts. The tram rides sometimes take longer then walking as they can only travel on the parameter.", "GUEST ROOMS", "In Punta Cana zone you have two choices: Basic Room/ Jr Suite", "Both have the same layout: A nice size bathroom with European Show/ Jacuzzi Tub (double sink), Very comfortable bed, huge high def TV with 150 stations (only like 5 that are in English). Fully stocked fridge, a safe, intuitive light technology and a balcony or patio. The basic room has a small sitting area with a chair. My wife and I got that room. The Jr Suite has a bigger sitting area with a sofa bed and a few coffee tables. My Bud and his wife splurged. Truth is the upgraded suite was only a few extra dollars more a night so it\u2019s all about personal preference.", "I would give this resort an A+ on the rooms.

My wife and I did 1 excursion with my Bud and his wife, which was NOT an ATS sanctioned trip. It was a gift from the travel club (since my bud and his wife got hooked in for a lifetime of travel). THE TRIP WAS A FREAKEN AMAZING EXPERIENCE that allowed the 4 of us to board a private yacht and visit an exclusive island (Catalina near La Ramona).  My Bud and his wife did book 1 other excursion from ATS and they said it was terrible. They paid over $250 to rent a glorified off-road vehicle called a Polaris. They were told they would each drive one, but they had to share. They were told the track would be gorgeous and by a beach (nope). They were told they were told they would get lunch but as they described it was a VERY lite fare and they had to pay extra for a soft drink. They were told it was a 4-hour trip it ended up being 7 (most in transport picking up other riders) and my bud and his wife almost missed our dinner reservation.", "You can also book excursions from NON-Resort sanctioned vendor who will approach you on the beach. These experiences are often cheaper, but buyer beware, especially with safety. Personally, my wife and I simply enjoy doing things on site when staying at all-inclusive resorts but if you want to venture away its best to do your homework on what you are getting.", "FOOD", "The food quality at GP was just \u201cok.\u201d Allow me to elaborate. The resort does NOT offer anything but buffet for both breakfast and lunch. I will say that the buffets were VERY impressive in quantity, but my personal preference would have been more quality then quantity. I will say it was the first time I ever went to a breakfast buffet that had corndogs, tacos and ice cream as some of their options. I found that interesting.", "As for the dinners, I would say the quality and variety were far superior to the buffets. We did not eat at every place, but we appreciated the options (Mexican, Italian, Indian, A Steakhouse, Hibachi Grill, Argentinian, a sports pub). Obviously, you should order as much as you like since its all included. My wife liked the Italian place (El Portofino) the most because of the romantic ambiance. I was super-impressed with the tastiness of the steaks at El Dorado. The most fun we had was the Japanese Hibachi. Yes, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve done a million times at home but the one at this resort was just simply fun.", "The Hibachi place is the only restaurant that requires a reservation. This policy is REALLY dumb. You can only do reservations 36 hours in advance and needs to be done at the lobby (in person). Thus, my bud\u2019s wife got up at 630am the day prior and there was a line. Thus, we had trouble getting a reservation. It was when my bud\u2019s wife shared that she was with the travel club that we were able to get a last-minute reservation.", "As for the other restaurants, be prepared to wait. Especially if you go at a busier time. We were there during Spring Break week. Because of the Travel Club privileges, my bud and his wife were able to secure some reservations but there were a few dinners where we had to wait it bit. One night I strategized. We ate a restaurant, which was about 15 yards for our room. The wait was 90 minutes. I put our name in, got a buzzer, went back to our room to shower and change and came back to wait for the final 5 minutes.", "I should mention that the resort has a TON of bars. Every pool has a bar, every lobby has a bar, and all the restaurants have them. The drinks were great. The only minor complaint was a lack of uniformity. There is a specialty drink my wife likes that some bartenders had the right mix and some looked baffled as they never heard of the drink before. Its was a very minor thing.", "Our favorite bar was Hemingway\u2019s, which was a classy adults-only chill place in an air-conditioned spot next to the Punta Cana lobby.", "POOLS/ BEACHES", "The resort has 5 pools (not including the one at the spa). I had zero complaints. The pools were large, we were able to find chairs (even on busier days). The activity staff was great in getting people involved. Lots of pools if you have little ones. Pools were all centrally located. We had one right outside our room. ", "I do want to mention my favorite pool. Quite frankly it was THE BEST PART OF THE RESORT. There is a pool called \u201cThe Secret Pool.\u201d It is located near the TRS zone. Thus, many guests do not know about it. The pool is RESERVED for Adults only. Thus, it was quiet and tranquil. The one exception is on Tues/ Fridays from 2pm \u2013 4pm when they have a foam party. I\u2019m not going to lie, the foam party was REALLY a lot of fun. I highly recommend.", "The Secret Pool also had tons of seating since not many people use this pool. The best feature is it\u2019s the only pool on site that\u2019s open 24 hours. The four of us did a late-night swim our 2nd night and had the whole bar essential to ourselves.", "There is 1 thing I did NOT like about the pools and it fits with my overall theme of the resort. The resort has a policy where you need to hand them pool towel cards, which everyone gets one towel. When you are done, you return your towel, you get the pool cards back\u2026even if you bring it back the next day. The reason is practical (so no one steals towels) but are they really that expensive that it worries them people are stealing towels? The true reason they do this is because the person who gives you your towel is also the person who is selling excursions and its incredibly annoying\u2026truly. I think this is an easy policy to change\u2026stop harassing guests to buy something every time they want a clean towel.", "The Beach: Not much to say other then every room is close to beach access, lots of chairs available, water is refreshing, and once again tons of people walking around trying to sell you stuff. In defense of GP, the beach is public thus they are NOT responsible for the people selling stuff on the beach, which I should mention means you should be more cautious on what your buying. Especially if it involves somewhat unsafe water activities.", "SPA/ CASINO/ ENTERTAINMENT/ SHOPPING", "My wife and I skipped out on the spa and casino this time around. My bud and his wife did visit both. They said the spa was fabulous. I\u2019ll take them at their word. I looked at the prices and the treatments were high in cost but relative to any other resort, cruise, exotic destination, probably in-line with others. GP gives you coupon books to save and not surprising, not surprising, lots of workers walking around the pool offering spa discounts.", "The Casino looked cool and is centrally located. It just did not appeal to me and my wife. My bud went in for a few minutes, lost money and that was it. There are 2 areas to shop. Stores near the casino area and stores near Bavaro lobby. They literally have every souvenir you can imagine. We are suckers so we indulged and bought a bunch of stuff for our kids and folks. Here is what I can say, we later compared prices that we paid in the GP stores to the same items in the airport and were surprised that the prices at GP were a few dollars less. We made out good.", "The ENTERTAINMENT AT GP FLAT OUT SUCKED! To me it was the most disappointing part of the resort. When we went to Punta Cana a few years ago, I told my wife the entertainment can\u2019t get any worse. Well GP proved me wrong Its not the main attraction of an all-inclusive but it certainly would tie a nice bow at the end of the day.", "I should clarify a bit. The entertainment in the lobbies were solid. It featured some small bands and talented solo acts. The entertainment at their featured theater was awful. Here is why. ", "The theater itself was SPECTACULAR. My bud, who is an actor and theatrical teacher remarked on how high-end the lighting equipment was in the theater. It was the talent creativity and variety in the shows that lacked. GP did not advertise what the shows were each night. We had to ask around. What we learned is that every night was essentially the same show. It involved the house dancers, who were not good. Every night same dancers but different theme. I would have liked to see some acrobats, jugglers, impersonators, SINGING maybe! With a theater set up that good its like putting $10,000 rims on a 30-year-old car.", "***GP had a great kid\u2019s area and we happen to catch a little bit of the kid\u2019s entertainment before our show. It seemed way better then what we got.", "Overall: I would say that the stay at GP was solid. Certainly, there are a few things we did not like but the GOOD far outweighed the bad. It was great value for the price."]},

It was very much appreciated. ", "Check-in was delayed by half an hour or so, but we were prepared for it after reading the reviews online, and we just went with the flow.

Clean, and well-kept. We were in awe with the palm trees and views every day. It\u2019s great that the palm trees provide shade at the beach, as there is no need for huts and umbrellas. There were always ample chairs on the beach, so there was no need to get there early to snatch a lounger. The white sand and ocean combination is beautiful - there is seaweed both on the sand and in the water, but the ground workers are out there on a daily basis trying to do some clean-up. ", "Note: You will find other people (locals/people from other resorts) at the beach, including kids (locals were only there on the weekend). There were life guards and security guards patrolling the area but they never asked any of them to leave. Not sure if this is common across all resorts on Bavaro Beach - but something to note. We did go over the Easter long weekend, which may have been why it was extra busy on Saturday. ", "FOOD: ", "The food at Barcelo Bavaro Beach was really good. We ate at the Main Buffet for Breakfast and Dinner, and normally had lunch at La Brisa. The pastas, pizzas, and omelettes were always tasty and filling. Shoutout to Caman\u014d for making wonderful pasta, and Alexis for his crepes every night. We tried two a la carte restaurants (La Brisa and Chez Gourmet), but preferred the food at the Buffet as the options for vegetarians were limited. ", "ROOM: ", "My favourite part of the room had to be the stunning views - we could see both the ocean and the swimming pool (we were in the mid 2000\u2019s). It was great to sit out in the balcony and hear the entertainment at night (Note: If you\u2019re an early sleeper, you probably would not prefer this as it is quite loud even at 11:00pm) The room was tidied on a daily basis, and we didn\u2019t have any problem with house-keeping. The one downside of the room had to be the washroom. The toilets flush was terrible and shower pressure was OK. ", "SERVICE/ENTERTAINMENT: ", "We were happy with the service we received at Barcelo Bavaro Beach. The workers were always kind, happy to entertain or offer a hand. We really enjoyed the beach volleyball games, and morning aerobics session. They had different entertainment every night as well including Karaoke night, Michael Jackson Show etc. The waiters in the buffets were always quick to offer water and drinks, and we never had trouble finding a table for two when it came to meals. ", "COSTS: ", "You will be required to pay $45.00 per person for WiFi, if you would like to have access at the resort. There is FREE WIFI at the Casino. However, this is at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace and is not convenient for Barcelo Bavaro Beach guests. It would be great if the resort could include WiFi for their guests as this is important to some people, like us. The WiFi connection was pretty decent overall. ", "There is an entry and exit fee in/out of Punta Cana, which totals to $30 USD per person. ", "Excursions can be booked at the Guest Services Centre with your representative. Just be cautious about the price they tell you because they may try to rip you off. We did the horse back riding excursion (2 hours) and loved the experience. They do tell you that the excursion will be about 2 hours with 20 minutes each way, but it ends up being about 6 hours as you pick up other people from other resorts before getting to the ranch.

Over the years they have added to the palapas so there usually is no rush to get up early in the morning to \u2018reserve\u2019 your place in the sun and shade.", "  ", "While the beach around the palapas should be cleaned much more regularly, a first step has been taken with the elimination of Styrofoam cups and straws \u2013 these have been replaced by reusable plastic cups and no straws.  Now if only smokers would stop considering the sand their ashtray and if the Princess would show more interest in keeping their beach clean, it would be perfect. Their haphazard beach clean-up just doesn\u2019t cut it!", "There is a warning in each registration package that \u2018reserving\u2019 beach chairs is not allowed.  A common issue in most resorts.  If you leave your stuff (books, towels, sun glasses, sun tan lotions, etc.) on your chair prior to 8:00 AM and leave the chair unoccupied for any length of time up until 8:00 AM, there is a chance that your stuff will be removed to the towel hut adjacent to the beach.  While in theory that\u2019s a fine policy, in practice it is just an irritant. ", " ", "When speaking to the Customer Service Manager this policy is due to some people reserving a chair/palapa and then not showing up for the best part of the day.  Fair enough.  But the policy is haphazardly executed:  some days towels, etc. were removed and other days not.  Around the pool the \u2018reservation system\u2019 was in full swing with no action from the Princess\u2019 staff.", "  ", "More frustrating was that on most days the \u201cprime real estate\u201d palapas next to the water were reserved by 7:00 AM and unoccupied until much after 8:00 AM, but never disturbed by the Princess\u2019 staff.", "   ", "Equally irritating \u2013 as happened to us - was the removal of our stuff when almost 50% of the chairs/palapas were still unoccupied during the day.

If people want to get up early to reserve \u201ctheir favourite spot\u201d, let them.  BUT, if people reserve a chair but then DON\u2019T use their chair DURING the day, THEN remove their towel.

So get this:  a man can be casually dressed in shorts and a t-shirt; a woman can go casually dressed with open-toed shoes or sandals; but a man has to wear closed-toed shoes.  Not sure the genesis of this rule but hardly a replacement for the requirement in the past that men wear long pants.", " ", "But be prepared for a number of other negatives.  While last year the service was exemplary in the Casabe, this year the service saw a severe deterioration on some days.  ", "Last year one maitre d\u2019ess would show you to a table and ensure it was clean and set up, this year she saw you to a table and simply left you to fend for yourself.  Since we were a party of four we frequently had to set up our own table with plates and cutlery with no server in sight.  On more than one occasion we saw 5 or more staff joking around at the entrance to the Casabe while glasses were empty and dirty dishes were piling up on people\u2019s tables.  Food carelessly spilled on the floor by a server - and seen by one of the managers \u2013 was simply left there to be a danger for someone slipping (we called attention to this twice).  A request for wine was frequently forgotten as the server trotted off and disappeared.  Again, I blame the Managers - of which there were a number floating around \u2013 who were not managing.", "Another peculiarity:   we found that at the Casabe lunch a full complement of cutlery would be on the table (two knives, three forks, one dessert spoon).  But at dinner - most people\u2019s main meal - just a knife and a fork were set.", "  ", "The same approach seems to have taken hold of the Beach Bar, a casual breakfast and lunch restaurant during the day (it turns into the Mare Nostrum in the evening).  In the past a server would serve coffee and get you a mimosa.  And he would remember your request day to day.  Now it is totally self-serve with the \u201cserver\u201d simply doing the clean up \u2013 when he is around (he was absent more than he was present). Too bad this personalized service for which the Princess was known has disappeared.", "Finally, the rooms are large and comfortable.  New pillows and a firm bed were a marked improvement over other years.", "   ", "Unfortunately there still is the wasted space of the hot tub in each room.  And there still is the absence of a dresser and only five shelves for your belongings.   (We solved this by bringing foldable shelving which you can hook to the closet pole \u2013 only $10!).", "  ", "As for drinks, there still is no ice machine anywhere \u2013 you have to get ice from the pool bar.  And the fridge in each room now contains: 2 Coke, 1 Sprite, and 2 Budweiser each day.  If you want more than 2 Budweiser per day you will be charged $3.00 more each (small print on a card on the fridge).  If you bring your own liquor \u2013 highly recommended since like most resorts the liquor and wines at the Princess are second grade) you will need to go to the pool bar daily and ask for a bottle of mix.", " ", "So will we go back?  The weather was great. The beach is wonderful for long walks and people watching.  The Princess\u2019 own beach area is roomy and less crowded than the neighbouring resorts.  The Princess has the right combo of quiet and noise - they have mercifully kept the Latino boom box music down along the beach and the animation team only makes noise around the pool in the late afternoon.  And for those who want more activity and noise there is the fun beach dance party each week as well as fun each evening in the Lobby Bar.  My complaints notwithstanding, our party of four certainly enjoyed ourselves once again.  So time will tell."]},

After much research and changing reservations twice we made the decision to stay at Paradisus Palma Real for the beach location. We picked the right spot. We stayed in the adult-only section of the resort. Check-in was flawless. Vilma in the Royal Service lounge was phenomenal (English exceptional). From the moment she introduced herself and I looked out at the ocean I knew this was the place. Then the second person we were introduced to was our butler. FRANCIS NEWTON.....my first thought was \"we are never this lucky\"!! English exceptional! He went above and beyond to make our vacation wonderful and he did. The pool, beach area, our suite was great!. The housekeeping was great! We went to try and find our particular housekeeper on our last day and she was not there. ", " Now, the reason I did not give 5 stars and the only reason.. The food, I felt the food was sub-standard all inclusive resort food. After three meals we went to some of the restaurants in the area. All excellent,  Noah, Jellyfish (which was a walk down the beach), Toc beach bar (a walk down the beach), and Lorenzillo's. Now, I do wish we would have given Passion a try but after the first part of the week we changed our mind and just did not go. We are going back with the family in July and will try Passion. ", "We will be going back and staying in The Reserve AT THE BEACH. When I booked the reservation I requested Francis, but this area does not have butlers but family concierge. I do think the resort should offer butler service for maybe an extra charge if traveling with a family. I feel that if you are in \"Royal Service\" as the hotel calls it you should also have access to that service. You are already paying the extra.

Particularly in the evenings, there is no live music or bars or entertainment of any kind within walking distance. The 'Punta Cana Village' just over the road consists of about half a dozen mediocre overpriced restaurants, and for a two week stay they get boring very quickly. Drink is expensive in and out of the hotel, in fact 50 - 100% more than holidaying in Europe. Price quoted for a taxi to 'downtown ' Punta Cana was said to be $30 each way, so didn't fancy spending around $700 for what you can get by just walking out of the hotel in other places.

There are only 8 sun beds, 3 of which are wrecked and the others have seen better days. Also the free shuttle that takes you to the beach etc is frequently used by people not even staying at the hotel. I'm sure one of the busses is an ex school bus as there is only about 6\" in between the seats and no leg room if you're taller than 4'6\".", "We looked at the 'trips' offered by the hotel but as they range from about $90 - 150 pp compared to Thomson offering similar for 2/3 of that we thought it was another rip off", "So if you're looking for a short stay, money's no object or a totally brain dead holiday, come on down.

We heard about Excellence Punta Cana through our travel agent are are SO glad that we stayed here. We had booked a 10 day trip in a suite with a garden view. We ended up splurging and upgrading to an ocean view room (which was absolutely beautiful but not necessary because we only spent about an hour a day in our room). From the moment we were dropped off at the resort, we were treated like royalty. We received champagne at the front door, had our bags taken to our room for us, and were personally led to our suite. Our door had a sash that said \"honeymoon\" and there were rose petals and towel swans on the bed (such a nice touch!). Every day we woke up and had a delicious buffet breakfast at The Kitchen Table, got a cabana by the water, and relaxed until dinner. Servers would come by the cabana every couple of minutes to bring any drink you can think of. You can even get free room service to your cabana! In the evenings we would go to dinner at one of the many restaurant choices. Our favorite was Chez Isabelle (French restaurant). Their French onion soup, scallops, and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e were exquisite.  We would end the day by going to watch their evening themed show (circus, broadway, disco, burlesque, pop, Michael Jackson tribute, etc.). Their entertainers are so talented! Speaking of the staff, they are all the reason this trip was so incredible. No matter what me needed, someone was there to make sure everything was perfect. Danny Boy and Joendry were our cabana servers our whole stay and really became our friends. Joanna, JC (Jean Carlos), and Coca Cola on the entertainment team brought us a smile every night. Rosa, a hostess at many of the restaurants, was always smiling and very friendly. We would absolutely recommend this resort to anyone and everyone and will definitely be returning in the near future! Our only negative was the portion size of the food, but since it is all-inclusive, you can order as many entrees as you want!"]},

The Buffet offers an Omelette and Crepe station at breakfast and a Pasta Station at lunch and dinner. There was always a good selection of fresh fruits, chicken, meats and cheeses, seafood, vegetables along with various dishes for even the pickiest of eaters at the buffet. We always found something tasty to eat and never walked away hungry. From breakfast to Dinner there was an ample food assortment to choose from.

Enjoyed the service and food at Villa Magna (although nothing will ever compare to Italian food back home). The Olive Tree (Mediterranean) being my favorite restaurant at this resort.

Anthony at Gabi Beach bar - a sweetheart. Juan Batista at Sunrise bar made the best pina coladas. Anthony, our Circle Butler was more than amazing, he went above and beyond to make our trip amazing. Jonathan at the Reserve pool- amazing. Ramon and Juan at the reserve beach were also amazing. Honestly, the staff members make the trip and these names are only a few of the people who went the extra mile to not only help us have the best vacation, but they are great people who are great to talk to. I cannot give this place more than 5 stars but i would if i could. It is gorgeous, clean, and so so fun. I am 24 years old and my parents are 60 - everyone from every age in between found something to do and a way to have the most relaxing time. There\u2019s always something to do. I hope the amazing people who work here are getting the credit they deserve and I hope this comment not only gets them recognition for their outstanding service, but inspires anyone to take the trip to this resort.

We were in the \"preferred\" club, so that was a nice benefit to be able to go anywhere and get special privileges like going next door to Now Onyx which was beautiful--you cannot get into their preferred pool area though FYI. The \"leave me breathless\" song is forever engraved in my brain because of this trip (and not in a good way). The music selection was very techno/EDM-based and although my husband and i like to party, I feel like at least some of the resort should have some type of relaxing/island music and/or popular music playing. That was the biggest turn off for me. Also, the personal concierge--although a neat idea, perhaps my husband and I are just not into being catered to like that, but ours tried to do too much and ended up irritating us a bit by booking dinner resos at places that were closed & setting up a \"special\" dinner at the french restaurant where we sat under a GIANT TV that displayed pictures of us and we were basically the center of attention for everyone walking into the restaurant, which is not our style. Would be nice if there was a beach bar to hang out at at night or something. Seemed like if you didn't go to a show, or the \"disco\" night club that didn't seem to open until after midnight, then there wasn't much to do. We hung out at the sports bar to watch football one night which was fun, and other than that we went to the Now Onyx lobby bar and had a good time there one night. Food was very good in my opinion (even room service)! Better than the Hilton Puerto Vallarta all inclusive which is the only reference I have. Overall, the beach was amazing (other than people selling you things), and foam party at the pool was pretty cool, but the music just killed it for me--probably means the Breathless resorts aren't for us anymore (we are 30), so we will probably try Secrets next time!"]},

This was not the case, we were taken to the office and were separated, then taken to breakfast with a sales person for each couple, they would not even start their \"pitch\" until breakfast was completed.  This half hour turned into 2 hours, and they would not take no for an answer, if you said no, they would send someone else in, said no again and they said fine, took us to another office and another person said they were getting our voucher ready and then pitched us again.

We were booked in the Punta Cana section in a standard room in building 75. This location was perfect for us as it was central and quick access. We spent several days at the beach, a couple at Punta Cana pool near the ocean and a couple days at the Palace Pool. We enjoyed the Palace Pool more than the Punta Cana pool.

We found out our group  was able to make reservations for any a la carte but for right when they opened each night so all we had to do was show up and get seated. Only a few spots were saved each night for our group to make but it did save time. We ate at the Japanese Teppanyaki (Palace) and it was good, also ate at Italian, Steakhouse (Punt Cana) and Asian (Bavaro). Lunch mainly at the Palace side near the Beach.

A little hard to find in the dark as we rarely went to the Bavaro Section.", "Rooms were OK and standard decoration like others we have been to. Shower set up in the tub is a little wacky in the design and takes a little figuring out. Be prepared for a little water on the floors also.", "We have stayed at the Barcelo Punta Cana (now Occidental Punta Cana) next to Hard Rock, Grand Bahia Principe Punta Cana and now the Palladium Punta Cana. I think out of these 3 the Palladium would be my last choice for a return visit. Mainly based on the layout and ability to book a la cartes at the others when we were there.

Kelvin, Manuel, and Frank at the main lobby bar at night were the best bartenders and honestly probably made the trip as fun as it was. The swim up room was nice, but we did not use it all that much. We preferred the beach, but they did upgrade us to a honeymoon suite when we got there and the room was gorgeous, with a jacuzzi in the room. The bleachers were amazing, the sand was soft, the water was blue, there were people bringing you drinks constantly if you wanted, and the BBQ lunch they cooked right next to the beach was spectacular.

No clean towels even though they came and made the bed. Had to ask for water because they never came to restock. Didn't replace the empty box of tissues. Language barrier is a real problem. When you ask for certain things for your room, they don't understand. The restaurants are not too bad. Some are good and some are average. The beach is fabulous. Drinks are always flowing. We also lost power two nights in a row for about an hour. No storms in the area. The spa is wonderful. You can get rides very easy all around if you need to.

The hotel was quiet at night time and the bed very comfortable.  We celebrated a 50th wedding anniversary at the hotel and Alexander at Guest Services made the evening a night to remember.  There was party of 8 and he had the table decorated and a beautiful cake with candles for the couple.  The food was great and the biggest and best surprise was one of the servers (and I am really sad that I did not look for his name but he was at Italian Restaurant on both nights when we went - March 15 was the anniversary date) sang a spanish love song to my sister and her husband.  He was a lot better than the band that played in a couple of the restaurants.  Now that is service, we only paid for the cake.  The maid service was excellent with turn-down every night.  They were always smiling and everyone always said \"hola\" in the morning, afternoon and night.  Drinks were excellent and the only restaurant that was not great was Fondue.  Too many people for that venue so service lacked there.  Steakhouse was excellent as well but know the meat you want, we had Beef Fillet Tip and I had mine medium-rare which was done to perfection.  With party of 8 there were a couple of errors in the meal placement but overall very good.  We are not a fan of the house wine but if you order wine it is nominal to enjoy a fairly good selection.  I didn't have desserts with exception of afternoon ice cream so couldn't tell you about the taste and my husband got a fried egg one morning that had a red yoke (gross).  The pool is great and there is no worry about not getting a chair.  The games, etc are not loud but fun enough.  Karaoke night was truly good better than we thought it would be and we did enjoy a disco night at our hotel.  The rest of the entertainment was next door at Caribe Princess.  I was not bored and the walks on the ocean and playing in the waves was perfect.  The front desk were helpful and only drawback is there is only free Wi-FI in lobby but not the end of the world.  Miguel on front desk was very helpful and the morning breakfast server Daniel was so much fun.  I have been to many resorts in Punta Cana and always said that I like to try different ones.  I can honestly say this one I would go back to.  It is not such a big resort where you have to be bused around.  I love the idea of no reservation at the restaurants and the buffet and beach buffet was very good as well, not to mention beach bbq which was great.  The seafood restaurant was very good as well.  I had grouper which was done perfectly.  I am a pretty fussy eater and have to say there was plenty of good stuff."]},

There are 2 other pools on the resort they are very busy so if you want a chair you will need to get out in the morning and put some belongings on the chairs: note a towel will not stop people from taking your chair.", "There are towel stations located beside all pools and there were plenty to choose from while we were there.", "Water park: super fun they have tube slides and regular slides fun for the whole family.

There is a wave pool which is great to chill in on hot days in between water slides.", "Beach: amazing turquoise water with light puffy sand, great for walking along the beach. Tons of shelters and chairs to choose from, I would say get there early because they do fill up fast.  There is cabanas to rent which I think were $50 per day these are also located around the pool area to rent as well.", "Entertainment: we went to a few shows which were fun for the kids, I would recommend the magic show at the royalton my kids loved it.  The Royalton seemed to have better quality shows than Memories. ", "Rooms: very spacious and comfortable we had a double bed which was more than sufficient for our family. Great view of the pool from our balcony. Every room has a safe, mini fridge stocked with pop, beer and bottled water refreshed daily. Our room had A/C and a ceiling fan which kept it very a comfortable temperature. ", "Peacocks: very beautiful birds but as others have said they can be very loud.

{"hotel": ["Now Larimar Punta Cana"], "title": ["Great beach, not so great service"], "content": ["We just returned from a 5 day vacation with my husband where we stayed at the Now Larimar in Punta Cana. We stayed in a jungle view king bed room at the preferred club level.  will start with the good and end with the not so good. The first good is the price. My husband and I wanted a quick get away that wouldn\u2019t break the bank and that is what we got. The next good thing was the beach. The beach was very clean and there were a lot of lounge chairs and umbrellas, we never struggled to find a place to relax for the day. There was the main beach and then a small part of the beach that was for preferred club level. The pools were also great, there was a main pool for all guest and then two smaller pool for preferred club members. We spent our days lounging in the proffered area on the beach and alternating between swimming in the ocean and swimming in the pool. The other good thing was the availability of food. There was a barefoot grill which had good available all day so we were able to snack right on the beach all day. There was also a very nice restaurant on the beach for preferred club members where we ate breakfast and lunch every day. Now for the not so great. First of all check in was a mess. We booked through Expedia and they asked for a voucher immediately upon our arrival, something we had never been asked for before. I had to scramble to get WiFi on my phone to find our reservation and get a confirmation number, this how ever was not enough and I had to email them screen shots from my phone of our reservation. It was all very strange. After that was over rather than being brought to our room so we can finally relax we were forced to sit through a 10 minute sales pitch where we were invited to a breakfast the next morning (for a longer sales pitch) we told them we would go with no intention of ever going but we wanted it to end. We were finally brought to our room. This resort is large so we were given a small tour on the way which was nice. When we got to our room we had to wait so long for our luggage. To the point where my husband has to call and ask for it. The room is very dated. The bath room was nice but never really felt clean to me. The sheets, mattress and pillow were all either old or cheap, we couldn\u2019t tell. The room smelled very musty and wet. The air conditioner was so loud and sounded like a jet engine every time it turned on. The couch had a pull out which made it so uncomfortable. There was a DVD player (which we never had any intention to us) but there were cords that were cut from the back. There were not enough plugs at all. And the only plug by one of the night stands was taken by the WiFi booster. WiFi that was not at all good. Also the \u201cjungle view\u201d was trees and the view of the resort next store. It was also very loud. Next was the food, it was really not good, cheap, greasy and flavor less and on the whole I did not trust any of it and had a hard time finding something healthy to eat all week. The drinks were terrible. All of the mixers were so loaded with sugar and syrup it made my stomach turn. Stuck with Bacardi and coke all week because I trusted that. Next the service was terrible. One of the reasons we chose preferred level was the promise of beach butler service. Which meant one person who cam around maybe twice the whole day. Then once we placed our orders, if they remember to bring it back it was always warm and watered down. At any other bar (other than the lobby bar at night) we had to repeat three times what we wanted because they forgot. On a unrelated note there was no consistency amongst the glass wear which kinda drove me nuts. We attempted to go to two shows while we were there. Both were moved to the theatre without any form of announcement so we missed both after waiting in the courtyard for a hour each time. I understand that things can change and there was a threat for rain but at the very least you can tell the waitresses who can ask around and let people know. On our last night we went to Spice to get hibachi. Please don\u2019t waste your time. It was 20 minutes. Barely a show and we had no choice in food. He just made some and gave it to us. My hubby and I wish we had just had dinner there instead. Overall we wanted a cheap vacation and got exactly what we paid for, it was the last time we go cheap on something like this as it was so not worth it. The beach was nice, the service was awful. "]},

This time of year there is a lot of sea weed but the resort does everything they can to clear the beach all day and night long. They also have nets out in the water to cute down on what comes ashore. They also offer you a VIP membership and give you a full tour. Everyone with that was very nice and not too pushy. The program does seem very smart for people who travel here a lot.

One of the most quiet resorts we have been to, with most of the disruption being caused by ill-behaved guests themselves and held tours along the beach (see further).  STAFF: smiling and friendly, even when we did not have the twins with us :). RESTAURANTS: good number of \u00e0 la carte restaurants without access restrictions nor fancy dress code; food selection and quality generally fine, a round-the-clock pizza couter, a coffee & desert counter, and the bar in the large lobby hall serves higher end liquors - the 15 yr Brugal rhum makes an excellent desert!

We arrived at 12pm on the 28th since we stayed at an AirBnB next door (residential area) the night before.  Room was not ready, but they took all of our paperwork and gave us one card per person to claim towels by the pool. So from about 12:30 through 2:30, we walked around and went to the pool. You can use all amenities while you wait for your room, just make sure you show the little paper they give you at the front desk when they ask you for your room number at the buffet or restaurants. No other place will they ask for room number on the resort, except the security personnel at the beach if they believe you\u2019re an outsider from the next door residences or resorts. Returned to front desk at 3:30, and our room was not ready until 4:30 pm.  I recommend you get there as early as you can so you can enjoy close to a full day at the resort.  If you get there at 3 or later, expect long waits, we noticed a few buses arrived with new tourists\u2019 right at 3 pm for check-in. Overall check-in experience rating is 4 out of 5.", "ROOM: The room is your typical hotel room with one or two beds (two in our case since it was 4 of us), a bathroom, refrigerator with a few items, and a porch. We were in building 22 on the first floor, which is within a 1-2 minute walk to the main buffet, the Kids drop off zone, the Japanese restaurant, the main lobby, the theater, and pretty much everything near the front lobby.  There were a lot of mosquitoes on the porch, but we also had two straight rainy days, so I\u2019m sure that had something to do with it. I did see a group of workers spraying the plants around the resort with what I think was bug repellent/killer. Overall rating 4 out of 5.", "RESORT GROUNDS: Beautiful and clean. Just about every spot was \u201cpicture perfect.\u201d The resort is not huge, but it\u2019s not small either; I think it\u2019s just the right size since everything is within a 1 to 4 minute walk or less.  There were a lot of workers keeping the buildings, grounds, and pools clean. There\u2019s also many workers at the restaurants, lobby, drink/snack stations, etc. They\u2019re all over the place, but not invading your personal space. Overall rating 5 out of 5", "TRANSPORTATION: they have golf carts to drive you around the resort, but were mostly used for transporting new arrivals and those leaving to and from the front lobby.  On the rainy days, they were giving people rides from their buildings to the restaurants.  I suggest you tip them; I did every time and had a personal driver that I would call and request at the front desk. He came and got us a few times during the pouring down rain.  He also found me an umbrella, after I was told by the front desk that umbrellas were only for those in the \u201cpremium impressive\u201d area. So, bring one or two small umbrellas if you can fit them in your luggage (just in case). Overall rating is 5 out of 5", "FOOD: We ate at the \u201cGRILL.\u201d  Their self-serve station was fine, but the a la carte meal (steak) wasn\u2019t that great. They serve ribeye and New York steak, and it just wasn\u2019t what we\u2019re used to. Rating is 3 out of 5.  There\u2019s a pizza place next to the Grill and the pools that has small pizzas and nachos, along with drinks. They are open until 2 am I think.  We thought the pizza was undercooked and ordered personal pizza (well-cooked and crunchy) several times. We tipped the guy a few dollars each time. This was our go to place for lunch since its right next to the pool. Rating for this place is 4-5.  We did not visit the Italian and French restaurant that are above the \u201cGrill\u201d on the second floor.  These three restaurants have ocean view.  We then ate at the Mediterranean restaurant; while it was beautiful and cozy on the premium side of the resort, the food was not great. We ended up going to the buffet later that night where we found a much better meal. Ratings for this one is 3 out of 5 only because it\u2019s very nice, romantic, and cozy.  We ate at the Japanese, right off the bat this is one gets 5 out of 5. Without a doubt the best. They cook your meal in front of you (same menu item for all 10 people at the table). The chefs cook in front of you. We tipped the check and waiter about USD$14.  This is the only restaurant that requires reservation for dinner (no lunch served). Be in line as early at 10am; they start taking reservations at 11am-12pm.  If you\u2019re at the back of the line, you may get stuck with the worst times for dinner (9:30pm, which is when the night shows are going). If you have more than 2 people, I suggest you make it to the front of the line to pick your time. The Buffet restaurant is next to the Japanese restaurant and the front lobby.  We actually found the buffet to be the second best; while not everything is pleasing to the eye or the mouth, they have plenty of variety to choose from.  Breakfast was probably my favorite since you can get your fried eggs, omelet, and other local dishes I like to eat like Mangu, yucca, salami, etc, since I\u2019m also Dominican.  Dinner was very good, and the service seems to be better at dinner since there\u2019s less people eating at the buffet (due to visiting the other restaurants).  So, the buffet is not bad at all, and they stay open until 10pm for dinner, and as early as 6 am for breakfast. Each meal time is about a 3-4 hour window; you will never go hungry at this place. OVERALL, food was ok. If you\u2019re looking for top of the line food, consider a much small resort that serves a much smaller number of customers. These people are cooking for thousands of people constantly, so do not expect to get an a la carte top of the line meal every time. Rating for this one is 4 out of 5.", "POOLs: I counted three (with one being on the premium side).  There\u2019s two by the \u201cgrill\u201d and beach, and we stayed on that side of town.  Pools were clean.  People get to the pool as early as 7am to put towels and personal items on chairs (claiming a chair). Some people would be gone all day, but had a spot at the pool.  This is so annoying, but we had to do it ourselves to ensure we had a spot since the girls (6 and 11) spent most of the time at the pool). They switch wet towels for dry ones as long as you have your towel card that\u2019s given to you at check-in. Rating for this one is 5 out of 5", "BEACH: there were seaweeds on the sand and on the beach\u2019s floor (not on the surface).  There was a crew cleaning the seaweeds on the sand, and I saw some the first day cleaning some in the beach water.  There are some barriers that prevent higher waves and seaweeds from coming in, but the water is still not as calm as what you see on the southern side of the island. It\u2019s a bit rough, but that\u2019s why there\u2019s pools. Chairs at the beach are also claimed early in the day, so get there early to get you a chair or two.  There are a few drink stations by the beach where you can get fresh fruit juice, water, etc.  There was a good number of people at the beach, and you can walk off the resort property on to both sides. I ran about 4 miles roundtrip a few times. I recommend you get out there early in the morning and run/walk to other parts of the beach. There\u2019s a few residential places as well as resorts nearby. They are building what seems to be a Pier right on the resort's beach. It looks like it's still a month away from completion, or less. The construction was not disruptive. Rating for this one is 4.5 out of 5", "VENDORS: vendors are allowed to walk on the beach, but cannot come up to the property line where the chairs are; so if you want to do any business with them, they will ask you to come down closer to the water (lol).  There were a few guys walking around with a few exotic animals charging a fee to let you take a bunch of pictures in different poses with their animals (monkey, birds, iguana, etc).  There\u2019s also ladies who do braiding, the coconut guy, and a few other vendors.  I paid the same price to get my two girls\u2019 hair braided than I would have paid for just one in the resort.  Vendors definitely have better pricing, but you have to make sure they don\u2019t overcharge you.  The resort is built to provide everything you need or want within the resort, you may just have to pay a little more.  No one should pay more than USD$2 on a coconut; a lady said she was being charged $15 and paid $7.  I only paid $1, but only because I\u2019m considered a local tourist. Just remember that vendors will cut the price by almost half or more if you negotiate. ", "ENTERTAINMENT: The staff does their best to provide fun entertainment at the theater and at the pool.  Michael Jackson show was the best, but there were a few other funny ones.  We did not make it to the children\u2019s shows.  The WiFi is only available at the theater, and I hear it\u2019s not that great.  You can either pay for WiFi, or just walk out the resort and get a simcard for internet on your unlocked phone, this could cost you about USD$5 or less for a whole week. I was nice having my own internet on my phone, and it\u2019s probably cheaper than the daily fee charged at the resort.  I believe you can do the same inside the resort. Rating for this one is 3 out of 5", "OUT IN TOWN: You can literally walk out the resort, turn left, and walk for one more minute. You will arrive at a small restaurants area where most locals hang out at night.  There\u2019s a mini-market where you will find just about anything.  I recommend you get out there at least once during your stay so you can see more than just the resort.  The area is safe to talk at night. It\u2019s literally about a 3-4 minute walk from the front lobby of the hotel. Rating for this one is 4 out of 5", "GYM: very nice gym with plenty of machines to use. It\u2019s not a huge room, but It had a lot more than I expected to see. I ran on the beach and did my sit ups in the gym.  Check it out. Rating for this one is 4 out of 5", "TIPPING: The result is all inclusive, which means that you have paid for everything (food, stay, service, etc). However, I\u2019m a true believer in tipping for service. The people working at resorts work very hard and very long hours (one of the hosts at the buffet was there when they closed around 10:30 pm, and then I saw her there again at 6:30 am).  I know you have the money to tip, or else you wouldn\u2019t be on vacation. Please be grateful and give them a few dollars.  Average income for locals is about $400-$500 a month; I have family leaving in the DR, and trust me, that salary is only enough to survive.  I tipped everyone I could.  One note, it\u2019s a little difficult to figure out who to tip at the buffet during breakfast and lunch since you\u2019re assisted by like 2-4 people that bring drinks and take your plates. I found it much easier at night when we only had two waiters assist us. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t share the love. TIP people, TIP.  Tipping goes a looooong way; like when got an umbrella for my family during the strong rain.  Oh, the lady at the beach making those delicious natural fruit juices, guess what? Tip her too. I asked her if she gets tipping, and the response was, every culture is different, with a BIG smile, that pretty much meant NOT MUCH. So I obviously tipped her. The juices are good too.", "PREMIUM: This group of ELITE people (LOL), had their own side of the resort; what seems to be a private restaurant or snack place, and their pool by the Mediterranean restaurant. They also had an area by the beach. I looks like it was a bit quieter, but at the end of the day, we all eat the same food and enjoy the same entertainment and grounds. I\u2019m not sure how much more you have to pay, but we were happy with being on the other side of town where the fun happens.  I cannot comment on the extra features offered by premium.", "STAFF: Just about everyone we walked by would say \u201cHOLA.\u201d  Just give the same greeting with a smile. Not everyone there speaks English, so do not get frustrated and just call the front desk if you need something.  Some people may complain about the workers saying they are mean; while that may be true for some, keep in mind that they may just  not be understanding you, and probably don\u2019t know how to respond either.  I am very pleased with the service I was given. I did feel, however, that a few of the ladies at the small shopping store and the coffee shop where either quiet, had a little bit of that \u201cDominican woman\u201d attitude I\u2019m fully aware of and used to, or were just having a bad day.  Not sure if it was the tipping, but attitude changed a bit, LOL. I\u2019m Dominican, so I think there may have a perception that as one of them I probably wasn\u2019t going to tip, WRONG.  This is just my personal opinion, I may be, and honestly hope I am totally wrong.  I received respectful and friendly treatment from everyone.  ALSO, we called the front desk for an iron, which was delivered within 20 minutes.  We then called about an umbrella, and it was never delivered. Called again and where told it was just for premium members. So I finally got a worker to lend me one.   When you call the front desk don\u2019t expect them to meet your request immediately. While it is their job to assist you in having the best vacation ever, keep in mind that there\u2019s another 900+ rooms on the resort they also have to service. So if you can get off your butt and walk over to the front desk or ask one of the workers you see cleaning or walking around, you may have a better experience. Rating for staff is 5 out of 5.", "One last thing to keep in mind; if you use the ATM on the resort, ensure you know that USD$1 is DOM$50. So one dollar is 50 pesos. I helped a gentleman who wanted to withdraw USD$400, so that would be DOM$20,000 pesos.   ", "OVERALL Rating for this resort based on our experience is 4.5 out of 5. I hope this review helps you decide whether you want to go there or not. We would go there again and recommend it."]},

{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Fun week!"], "content": ["Nice resort. Very simple...one pool (but it's nice and you can also use the pools at two other resorts) One buffet...but it has everything you need and overall the food is very good. As all the reviews say, the staff are very very sweet and seem genuinely nice. Maybe they are all good actors, but they do make you feel like they actually like you! I do have a few criticisms though. 1) The lighting in the bedrooms is waaay too dark. Even in the middle of the day it's hard to see anything...especially when you're getting ready to go out for the evening and trying to do your hair and make-up. Maybe they could mount a lighted make-up mirror in the bathrooms for the ladies. I brought my own (after reading other reviews) but it wasn't big and bright enough. 2) I'd prefer bathrooms with a door, so if you get up in the middle of the night you're not disturbing your partner 3) Scrap that stupid rule about men having to wear closed toed shoes in the a-la-cartes. It makes no sense when women are wearing sandals. What's the difference between men's feet and women's feet? LOL My husband had on nice sandals with closed toes, but they had open spots on the sides and he wasn't let in. His only other shoes were runners. Since when do runners look better than nice sandals? They really need to think about that...because it really turned us off. 4) Be consistent and enforce the rule that you can't save beach chairs before 8:00. The same groups were always in the front row or two of chairs and you KNOW they had to be down there before 8:00. One morning I was down at the beach bright and early and the best chairs already had towels over them. The good thing is they never ran out of chairs...but some of them were way at the back where you can hardly even see any ocean. 5) The vendors on the beach weren't too bad. They really weren't overly pushy and some of them were quite nice to talk to...but...the ones that were on the grounds the night of the \"flea market\" were very pushy. Why are they even there? It sucks to be walking to dinner and have to stop every 5 feet to listen to their sales pitch. It's so dark out, you can't see anything anyway, so what's the point? I wonder whether they realize how much of a turn off it is for the guests? The guests at this resort are mostly Canadian, and it's just not part of our culture to be henpecked into buying stuff. I actually wonder how many sales the merchants make, because everyone I spoke with said they just tried to keep walking. Maybe they should come to the resort during the daylight (so you can actually see all the wares) and set up in one spot in a corner so you're not forced to walk through. They should also be advised by the management that they would probably make MORE sales if they just stood there and waited for guests to approach them! Over all it was a beautiful spot...and we would probably go back, but would be more encouraged to do so if those little changes were made."]},
{"hotel": ["Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Nice adults only trip"], "content": ["Stayed for 4 days 5 nights in a honeymoon suite (not our honeymoon).  Our first visit to the DR and this resort.  Easy short trip from the airport.  We arranged for private transfers.  Others complained about it taking long with stops at other resorts.  Worth the few extra dollars. Check in was swift and we were greeted with our first of many great drinks.  Room was nice (building 2).  Toilet shower combo was  a little tight and the frosted doors may turn some people off due to privacy concerns.  Didn\u2019t bother us.  No drawers, only shelves near the closet.  Room was made daily and towels changed.  Nothing is too far a walk here which is nice.  Beautiful pool although we stayed mostly on the beach.  The little bar shack near the tiki huts was great.  They make a great rum punch and the beer was cold and readily available.  They were able to make any type of drink you wanted.  The bartenders remembered our drinks daily.  I wish I remembered their names.  Never had a problem getting a lounger no matter what time of day.  The animation crew was there to have fun you but didn\u2019t pressure.  We played bocci, archy and crazy pool.  All fun with a few rum punches  in you.  The buffets were the best if the restaurants and you can always find something good to eat.  The ala carte restaurants were just so so but you don\u2019t come to a Caribbean paradise for Italian or Steaks. Lots of people complain about the wine at the restaurants.  We found the white to be passable but the red was served cold.  It might be more drinkable if they served it room temperature as red wine should but it might be a cultural thing.  So we ended up sticking to the beer at dinner and lunch.  The lobby bar was great and the singing/laughing bartender Emilio was excellent.  Great drinks there before and after dinner.  Met lots of other couples there and had great conversations with people from all over.  The bar at Mare Nostrum was also good.  Had plenty of Mamajuana  at all the bars and dinner.  We even bought  a kit to make it at home.  The shops at the resort are surprising affordable and had anything you needed. There were local shops just to the right of the resort on the beach which have lots of souvenirs but you will hassled and pressured to buy anything you look at and be prepared to bargain.  Note-alcohol is just as cheep at the duty free shop at the airport.  No need to buy it on the beach and lug it around.  The beach vendors can be annoying but a simple no thanks usually worked.  The time share people were the most intrusive.  We took advantage of the resort photographer and booked a private session after one evening\u2019s pictures came out great. The beach session photos were taken by Sarah and were wonderful.   Visit the spa for a few services which were all great.  Quiet place, not a party spring break place.  Older crowd.  Mostly mid 40\u2019s and up.  Too many great staff to remember and compliment.  Alexander at guest services was always helpful.  We tipped throughout the stay, they deserved it. "]},

I've had to request ashtrays from other hotels, so that didn't tell me much. There are no visible signs to state that there is no smoking either. I go to check out and was told that I had a $250 balance. I inquired why, and was told because I smoked in the room. I go back and forth with this employee and he tells me that my neighbors complained. Well why didn't you say something to me 5 days prior to me checking out? Wouldn't you say something to me to accommodate the complaining guest? There's already a language barrier with the staff beyond the front desk, make your rules clear for foreigners please! Mr. Sassy Pants at the front desk, you told me that there was a no smoking sign in the closet!!!! lol...anyway, I ending up paying them $50 for the misunderstanding and left.

This year we decided to make full use of our platinum plan and dined out at the other Princess hotels. You get picked up at the Platinum lounge and are brought to the restaurant. It was interesting to see the layout of the other hotels. They were also very pretty. We decided, however, that we preferred ours. The terrace, which all the rooms offer, is much nicer than a balcony. We, as Swiss, even tried the Swiss restaurant and found it cosy. Of course the fondues were not exactly served like at home, but that was not to be expected. We had the dessert chocolate fondue for the first time ever and found it quite a quaint idea of dipping fresh fruit and marshmallows into warm chocolate. The Brazilian restaurant was fun. All different kinds of meat, plus one fish, are brought to the table on enormous skewers and then carved onto your plate. My favourite was the pineapple and the lamb. The Mexican restaurant had a nice selection of dishes, too. ", "This year we found that the lunch buffet at the beach had definitely excelled in diversity and quality. Also I must not forget to mention that after having complained about the quality of the red wine for a few years now, we were pleasantly surprised to find that they have changed to another label. This wine is certainly much more pleasant to the palate. For those who are thinking about visiting this area for the first time, I would like to comment that the long, sandy beach is one of its kind. Weather-wise it was very windy again this year. We had quite a few days where we could not even walk along the beach and the waves were, of course, too rough.

He got us a great deal on 6 dives, but It didn't end there! We were able to book parasailing, banana boating, Dune bugging, and a Catamaran booze cruise with him. He was so helpful, and knowledgeable on other things with the resort we were struggling with.  He became just like one of our family, and group of friends. We were blessed to find him and have him as basically our tour guide and one stop excursion shop. He managed to get our group great deals, and we had a blast on everyone of our outings, and scuba dives with him.

It was the first time I was taking my 9 year \u2018old daughter in a resort. My expectations were really high and unfortunately were not met.", "When we arrived, we went right to customer services to mention our daughter\u2019s allergy to tree nuts. We were given a print out of the page I had seen on the website about allergy management. They simply circled the nuts rectangle on the folded piece of paper and we were given a few indications on how to proceed in restaurants. We were expecting something more professional like a laminated card especially for tree nuts allergy (I had done and brought one myself that was more formal).", "On our first meal at the buffet, I mentioned my daughter\u2019s allergy and showed the paper. The head of the buffet went around the buffet with us and pointed, somehow randomly, saying \u201cthis is ok\u201d, \u201cthis ok\u201d, \u201cthis ok\u201d, basically, everything was ok except when you could see nuts. I could have led that tour myself. I was expecting more. I wish I was asked what my daughter would like to eat and they could have gone to the kitchen, check with the chef for allergies and bring it back straight from the kitchen to reduce the risk of cross-contaminations.", "There were always less utensils then the number of dishes in the buffet. Once when there were only 2 spoons for 6 different choices, I asked it was possible to get an extra spoon. The answer was \u201csorry, not really\u201d.", "I have also asked to be able to read myself the list of ingredients on the burger buns bag at the beach restaurant. I was denied the possibility. ", "We went to \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d restaurants almost every night where we felt a little more reassured. We always mentioned the allergy and showed the card. Still, my daughter was brought an Indian butter chicken with almond toppings\u2026 The waiter was really sorry, but still. In the menu, it did not mention the butter chicken was served with almonds; it could be a good modification to make.", "Another point. I do not speak much Spanish and the staff often did not speak much English, so I suppose the language barrier was probably not helping either.", "The goods:", "- When I asked for pancakes \u201cespecial\u201d with no nuts at the buffet, the cook would do a really good job at washing her tools, using new batter, and I felt safe.", "- Some waiters in \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d did extra efforts and double checked with the kitchen staff to make sure the meal was safe.", "- Often when arriving at a restaurant or buffet, we were asked if we had allergies.", "As mentioned at the beginning of this post, my expectations were high, maybe too high. What I experienced is what I assumed any resort should be doing as a minimum. I had in mind a \u201cDisney standard\u201d which in my experience is the top experience for guests with allergies. I feel Palladium could have done more to reassure my daughter and her family.", "In general, we do not take much risk when it comes to allergies, and maybe some other guess may find the resort does enough. It all depends on how you manage your allergies and how much risk you are willing to take.", "I still gave a 3 star to the resort because if it wasn't for the allergies, we enjoyed our holidays. The resort is very nice and clean. We had a recently renovated room, the beds were comfortable, the pools and beaches were clean and beautiful and the food was good."]},

The resort was very full and the waiters were busy, which we took into consideration, but every time we asked for tea, coffee or simply water at the buffet, the waiters did not bring it. You are lucky to get a beverage if you ask multiple times and multiple waiters. For the amount of people in the hotel, they need double the staff. ", "Drinks: ", "The bars in this hotel are so sad, the worst I\u2019ve ever seen in an all inclusive resort. The main lobby bar had maybe 10 bottles of alcohol on the shelf, most of which were very cheap and impossible to drink. They were constantly running out of drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic (wine, rum, juice, etc.). You want a glass of wine? Well, too bad..you are drinking beer instead, because it\u2019s all they have. ", "Beach: ", "The beach was awful. Horrible smell of \u2018\u2019sewage\u2019\u2019, lots of rotting seaweed, but the worst part is, they DONT HAVE UMBRELLAS. They claim that the palm trees provide enough shade, but they DONT!

So for us\u2026pool it was. ", "Food: ", "The food was not bad, but not great either. Lots of meat choices, but absolutely ZERO seafood. So if you don\u2019t eat meat like myself, your choices are very limited. They did have an option to buy a lobster dinner, but it was way too overpriced. The main buffet was always so crowded, where you had trouble finding a table. And once you did, you had to chase the waiters for napkins or cutlery. We weren\u2019t able to try out any of the a la carte restaurants, except the Japanese, because the lineups to get inside were insane. The Japanese restaurant however, we really enjoyed.

We travelled to Punta Cana with a group of 6 people at the end of March and we were left extremely disappointed. Firstly, the service was awful, especially in the main buffet. It was so difficult to get any beverage, including water, coffee, tea, etc., as there was not enough waiters to serve all the guests. They seemed to be trying, but they needed double the staff to serve all the guests, as the resort was full.  On the daily basis, we had to ask at least 3 different waiters for a drink and were lucky to get it 15 minutes later. To get an a la carte restaurant was also impossible, as the lineups were huge. We tried twice, and after waiting in line for an hour or so, we ended up going to the main buffet.  For the 7 days we were there, we were only able to get an a la carte once. It was the Japanese restaurant and we really enjoyed it. The alcohol choices at all the bars are so ridiculous and sad. They have a few bottles of extremely cheap alcohol standing on the shelf, and the more decent, drinkable  alcohol was always out. They ran out of wine, champagne, juice and other beverages on the daily basis. The worst part of the resort was the beach. Lots of seaweed and absolutely no shade. For some reason, they have no umbrellas, so if you want to enjoy the beach, you are stuck under the sun. Unfortunately, we had to spend a lot of time at the pool, as we did not want to get burned. Overall, this resort is not even close to being 5 stars as they claim to be. I would give them 3 stars at most."]},

You can walk over an hour both ways in complete safety as you are always in front of other resorts. This enables you to burn off all the calories from the buffets. There was fresh fish to choose from everyday and you could have it grilled for you. We started every morning with a cappuccino and mimosa. There was a good variety and you could always visit the omelette station in the morning or pasta station at lunch or dinner. One note here is that they would use your ingredients if you wished. We only tried the steak restaurant. The fajitas were good although the chicken tacos were excellent. We attended a few shows in the lobby and they were fun.

The food and service was only average.

Now just so you know I had previously stayed at his hotel about 9 years ago and had the time of my life. At that time though the other hotel Barcelo Bavaro Palace was getting built still....To start off let me be clear that I had purchased my hotel and airfare through (Priceline.com) (which I will never do again either)... I had booked a beautiful ocean front Premium level King bed room. When I first arrived to the hotel we went into the Premium level check in area and the service was great everything was just how I remember it. Then we get directed to our room and from that point on everything was a mess. Well as soon as I walked in I noticed it was not the room that was in the picture when I had booked it, now mind you I had upgraded so I had spent more money to get the better room because I wanted a really fabulous room for my husband. Not to mention there were two full beds. So I told the bell boy this was not the room I had paid for what was going on, he kindly called down to the Premium level service desk and put me on the phone with them, I had explained to them that this was not the room I was suppose to get and there was no king bed, we were facing the ocean which was good, but other than that no. So the lady on the phone then had told me they do not have any rooms with king beds, but maybe tomorrow they will and they will change me then I said fine and hung up the phone, but in the back of my head it was still bothering me that it did not look like anything that was in the picture and this was the same room I had 9 years ago. So I decided to go on priceline.com and look up exactly how I had booked the room and there is was the room I had booked and a completely different picture, so I decided to bring my phone down to the service desk and try to explain and show them. While doing so the lady had called a representative at Priceline and explained the matter, I even spoke with them as well and all they could say was the rooms you book through them are not guaranteed. Which I was very upset at this point because I had paid more for the better room. Not to mention there false advertisement because apparently the room in the picture that they are promoting as a ocean front premium room is actually a suite. Now I know this is not the hotels fault this is all of Pricelines fault, but the next day when we went to try and change the room since they told me they had a king room available after we went half away across the resort it ended up being the exact same room different side of the resort and pushed two full beds  together. At that point I gave up, I was upset because the bed was super uncomfortable because now there was this huge line/space in between both beds. If things at this point could get any worse, but they did.....", "So after we arrived and got situated in the room my husband and I went down to a buffet (La Brisa) because we were starving from not eating all day. Now as I remember it 9 years ago the food was great and I never had a problem and loved everything so much that is why I brought my husband. So as we go to enter the buffet they have these glass doors that you enter so the food is kept inside and you eat outside, but there were flies everywhere. Which was alarming already, then you look at the food and nothing looked appetizing. Everything was either under cooked or overcooked and completely dried out. I was so disappointed that we just grabbed some nachos and sat down, I mean at that point what can I really do.So after that we spent the rest of the evening by the bar and just trying to enjoy the rest of the day. Around dinner time we went to a restaurant called La Dolce Vita which is Italian in the Palace resort (which in included) for dinner now I figured the food would be great in these restaurants since it was not buffet style. My husband dish was not bad, mine was pretty good but nothing that I would want to order again. Then from that night on every night we ate at a different restaurant. And for  breakfast and lunch you had to choose from the buffets which was either La Brisa or Caribe both were a mess and the food was just unacceptable.", "La Comedie (french) The bread was so hard you could through it at a wall and it would break. I order Chicken cordon bleu which is suppose to have ham and cheese inside of the chicken well there was no cheese, but cheese whiz sprayed around the plate for decoration.

I have no complaints on this restaurant everything was delightful.", "In the end through out my week stay I ended up just biting my tongue and trying to make the best out of the vacation. And basically not eating because when we did we would both end up in the bathroom and the food was just horrible there was no way around it. The sad part was that there were a bunch of other guests that we were talking to and they all felt the same way, everyone was so unimpressed with the food, we were all just basically trying to eat enough to balance the alcohol . ", "Unfortunately, after this experience I will not be returning anymore I feel that 9 years ago when I went everything was fresh the experience was amazing. And now the service has gone down, the food expectations have decreased, they do not even put presidente beer in the mini ref anymore in the room they put Coors light. That was a big disappointment. Why would you take the swim up bar out of the pool at a resort that is Adults Only makes no sense, they have one at the neighbor hotel, but not this one.  One of the good restaurants that use to be on the beach that served fresh fish and good beers like corona and stuff use to be included does not exist anymore.

This is our second stay at an Excellence resort - we have also stayed at Excellence Playa Mujeres (EPM) in an Excellence Club Two Story Rooftop Terrace Suite with Ocean View. We choose the swim up suite at EPC over a rooftop terrace room for this stay because (1) we really liked the look of the Cascade pool at EPC when we were booking a room and (2) we got a really good deal on the room.

We got 40% off our room with the labor day special.", " Use Seasons Tours transfer service (can book through Excellence website) to/from airport. It was easy to find them in the airport, and the transfer was low stress - great way to start and end a vacation. (We used them for our stay at EPM too.)", "If booking EC Jr swim up suite at EPC, we recommend:", " Request building 2 or 4 over building 1 - building 1 has ice machine and staff/custodial room directly across from the swim up sites and is in a higher traffic area, so rooms may be noisier.", " Request building 2 if you like more quiet/relation on your vacation and want easy access to the quieter upper Cascade pool - only 8 rooms have easy access to the upper pool, and most of the time the two of us were the only ones in the huge pool.", " Request building 4 if you like more party on your vacation - building 4 has easier access to bar, more lively pool scene, and pool and food servers come around much more often (likely due to more the restricted deck access to buildings 1 & 2)", "Things that went really well:", " The buildings and grounds are well maintained and staff is constantly cleaning and caring for the resort grounds", " Mille spa is beautiful and spa treatments are lovely. If you are in EC, highly recommend you do the complementary \u201caqua wellness\u201d session", " Top 3 favorite restaurants: Magna, The Grille, Spice", " Magna restaurant has a beautiful patio for dining al fresco", " Coco loco drink - get one if you like coconut", " Lots of white noise from the cascade pool waterfalls means you barely hear your neighbors when you are enjoying your deck", " Entertainment and entertainment staff - saxophone player is excellent, lounge singers are excellent, dancers are excellent. Evening shows are pretty good - my favorites were the Vagas show and the fire show", " Lots of beach and pool spots in the shade available - more so than at EPM", "Different color flags at the ocean beach to indicate ocean temperament/safety for ocean swimming", "Room for improvement:", " Tequila options are limited so if you love tequila, go to one of their Mexican resorts instead. If you are a rum fan, this is the place for you.", " Hand sanitizer: most restaurants did not have hand sanitizer available - The lobster house had it but the other restaurants did not. This is a health concern, especially in The Kitchen (buffet). I mentioned it to the EC concierge easily on and he said he'd follow up - Still no hand sanitizer by the time our vacation ended.", " Daily delivery of petit fours (perk of EC) was hit or miss - we received them about half of the time.", " Turn down service was inconsistent - sometimes chocolate + slippers out, sometimes no chocolate, sometimes no slippers, one time no chocolate or slippers", "Shout out to staff - Special thank you to the following staff members:", " Excellence club concierge staff - always greeted us with a smile", " Excellence Lounge bar staff - always remembered my drink order", " Magna club bar staff - they take a dry gin martini seriously", " Eliezer, server at Magna - excellent service, remembered our preferences, is kind, and has good sense of humor", " Wilmy, EC cascade pool concierge - you rock!!!", " All Ceilo bar staff is wonderful and patient - and special thanks to Johanna who went out of her way to find me to give me my drink order when I unexpectedly relocated - Thanks Johanna for your kindness and patience!", " Wilmer, server at the Grill - thank you for your good humor and for the dessert recommendation!", " Gertrudis, barista at Aroma who greeted me with a smile every morning and always remembered my order", " Cecelia at Mediterranean station at The Kitchen - great service, and tasty shrimp!", " Our room mini bar refill staff, who was super friendly and fun", "Other Considerations/tips for your stay:", " Please please please use quality sunscreen, re-apply it per bottle instructions, and limit your sun exposure. We saw a lot of guests who were very sunburned after only their first day at the resort - ouch! UV rays are no joke, people!", " If your room has a deck, we recommend moving the chair cushions under the roof overhang at night - it often rains over night", " This resort allows smoking. If you have any airway sensitivities, I do not recommend this resort. Often, you can relocate if someone nearby is smoking - but if you are in a swim up room and your neighbor smokes, you may not be able to use your swim up deck as much as you like.", " Regarding other reviewers concerns over theft - The safe in our room was located in one of the closets/cupboards. We had a motion activated camera on top of the safe the entire stay. At no point did any staff member open that cupboard, let alone try to enter the safe. My husband accidentally left his wedding ring on the counter once - housekeeping came while we were gone and the ring was not touched.", " Regarding other reviewers concerns about limited English-speaking staff: All concierge staff are fluent in multiple languages, including English. Servers and bar staff also spoke English well, and most staff members also spoke some French. If you know some Spanish, I recommend trying to use it - the staff will coach you and are very encouraging. If you are speaking to a staff member in English and they are not understanding you, please keep your cool. The staff member is most likely not at fault - after all, we are in their country and they are trying their best to speak and understand our language\u2026 not to mention having to interpret what we say in our many different accents from around the globe. Sometimes I couldn't even understand what some of the other English-speaking guests were saying! If you do not think your request was understood the first time, please do not repeat it louder - the staff is not deaf."]},

Victor, \"the horse man\" is what we dubbed him as, and you will soon realize why we named him this when you meet him at the Emerald Bar, just steps away from the beach.

Shout out to Chef Julio( Hulio) for his superb service. The other Al a cartes we visited were The Grill, and The Italian. If your not a Premium Guest, then all the Al a cartes, serve you on a first come first basis. You cannot make reservations unless your a Premium Guest. Wifi is available for free only in the Theatre area, and worked well. You can pay extra for Wifi or if your a Premium guest its included. The oceam view room we occupied was clean and spacious. The patio door, don't close it tight when your both out on the patio, you will get locked out. Speaking from experience.Its a great safety and security feature, but just a heads up as they must have a lot of people who encounter this problem of getting locked out on your patio.We were trying to conserve the A/C, so we closed the doors.. We just put the blind between the patio door closure after the first night so it didn't happen again..You room key card must be placed in the slot near the door if you want your lights and airconditioning to work. Another great feature if you are aware. The pools all close at 6:00pm, they are kept clean and so wonderful. I seen the pool cleaner every day just after 6:00pm and they orginize the chairs every evening by the pools and the beach.

The view from the room was amazing. It was spacious with a nice jacuzzi on the upper floor. The only thing I could criticize is that the hotel needs to get a maintenance program going as soon as possible to keep the rooms update and in good repair. A few of the issues I noticed were silly things like the taps leaked when in use. Also there was chips on the floor tiles and some of the furniture was scratched and marked. This is the only thing stoping it from being a five star resort from me. The beach and staff are amazing. Friendly and up for a laugh while trying to make you feel part of the family. In regards to the food at the buffet it was good with different theme nights daily. The only down side was the lack of choice of dishes. I think this is because it is a smaller resort that is not  catering for thousands of people in a daily basis. Drinks were good and not watered down. The specialty restaurants were ok with an exception to the steak house. The service was very poor and the staff seemed like they didn\u2019t want to be there. The food was in the steak house was ok but nothing to rave about. However the Chinese       restaurant on the sister resort is highly recommended as it was amazing.

Enjoyed the wait staff at the beach; very personable and attentive.", "- Rooms - clean rooms, well maintained, but starting to show some age.

Someone took us from the front desk downstairs to offer a welcome drink and basically, the sole purpose was to get us to schedule a timeshare pitch for the next morning; no thanks!", "- Beach - I had to wake up everyday before 7 a.m. to go reserve chairs at the beach; not what I want to being on my vacation.  No option to rent an umbrella at the beach once they're all taken.  Either you bake in the sun all day or get outside before 7 a.m. to reserve chairs with an umbrella.", "- Music - if you have any idea of heading here for a quiet vacation, you have to upgrade to the Xhale club (cost over $400 for us).  The music starts early (around 9 a.m.) and can be heard all the way out to the beach which is about 300 yards away.  If you have a room near the pool, you better be there to party, because otherwise the bass will probably just blow you away.  Too loud and obnoxious more than anything.", "- Theft - Someone stole money from my room and when I filed a report, it felt like I was accused of being the thief.  Security came into my room and went through all of my personal belongings including my dirty clothes, one by one, as well as wallets etc.... he said it was standard practice.  Made me feel very uncomfortable and pretty scared.  I've read on here where people say they've had money stolen from their safes and I have always been skeptical; well it happens people.  Luckily I had a small amount of money, but the experience definitely ruined my trip.  Someone contacted me via email afterwards saying they were investigating this, but what a sham.  Nobody spoke to me and told me they were closing the case.", "- Xhale club - the only reason to upgrade to this is for the location.  Don't expect to get all the upgrades they tell you during the up-sell pitch.  Getting away from the pool area is worth it unless you don't mind the loud music all day (it never stops, seriously).", "- I had another negative experience with a staff member that wanted my room number to charge me for a $5 vase that the wind blew down and broke.

On Palace side disco opens at 11 so never went.  Casino small and kinda sad.   No daytime entertainment at Pool or beach except silly games. Kinda fun but where's the live band?

I wont comment on restaurants since we not foodies other than to say some waiters/waitresses were friendly some very indifferent bordering on rude.", "Conclusion:  Wont go back. Maybe go back to DR but not here.  And after spending time at Palace side we wouldn't stay there either as a couple.  Way more crowded and tons of kids. The Premium level thing is just ridiculous to me.  Maybe they get better treatment and service?  They definitely get better choice of rooms and I guess better level of alchohol. We will try Jamaica next year after saving up all year like we did for our smelly room in the DR.  That said we had fun as we got up early and spent day on beach.

The beach is amazing, the water warm and the waves were fun. Often we didn\u2019t leave there until 5pm. There was never a problem finding a little hut for shade. It was a treat to have drinks brought to us on the beach and not just the VIP section . We had no trouble finding something to eat. There were theme nights at the buffet that offered something for everyone. We didn\u2019t try the fondue house but did eat at the other restaurants. The best meal was at the Rio Grande steakhouse: ribs were the best I\u2019ve ever had! The risotto at Il Bacio Italian restaurant was also yummy and perfect. The seafood paella at Mare Nostrum that we looked forward to from our last visit was worth the wait. We had breakfast and lunch at the beach buffet most days and enjoyed eating outside in the shade with the best view ever! It was really touching to be remembered by so many people. That is one of the many benefits that come with a smaller resort whose employees focus time and energy on the guests, working hard to make our holiday fun and relaxing. Adrian made sure we had everything we needed, remembering our preferences and Felix made sure we had pillows and were comfortable. He keeps the beach bar clean and welcoming. Other employees who stood out for us were Raysa, Israel, Francis,  and Alexandra. These wonderful people are what keep guests coming back year after year. They work hard and it shows "]},

For background purposes, we have visited over a dozen other resorts, including Excellence, Secrets, Iberostar, Valentin, Catalonia, Riu, Dreams, Ocean Maya, Palladium and Club Med\u00a0 brands.", "Positives- this resort is lovely, with the tropical d\u00e9cor we love, the small size,\u00a0 and the gorgeous beach.We found the food very good, and the resort clean and well maintained, including the rest rooms.\u00a0\u00a0I won\u2019t comment on the room, as it\u2019s deficiencies have been well documented in other reviews (poor bathroom/sink design, inadequate lighting in bath and entryway, no drawers). The room was nice and cool, but we found all our clothes damp- the dehumidifying part of the AC isn\u2019t doing it\u2019s job.The staff tried hard to keep the beach clean, despite ignorant guests using the beach as their ashtray. I watched a man use a Qtip to clean his ears and drop it on the beach- who does that?! With all the negatives we encountered right from the start,\u00a0 we were quick to decide that we would not return, due to what we felt were subpar amenity and service issues.\u00a0After we had been there a few days, though,\u00a0 we let go of our minor gripes\u00a0, determined to  enjoy it for what it DID have. If ,despite my research, we had known in advance these deficiencies, we'd have been prepared for the resort\u2019s limitations, and as a result, not let\u00a0them bother us as much.\u00a0We did end up having a great time,\u00a0 and by the end of our stay, decided that we might return, now that we know\u00a0the lay of the land.\u00a0\u00a0 We did have conversations with guest services and the guest service manager, prior to our departure, regarding most of these issues. That being said, these are the things that need to be fixed:", "- the inconsistent dress code enforcement. First, they need to update both their website and the info sheet they present at check-in. My husband was turned away our first night, wearing linen slacks, collared shirt, and CLOSED TOE leather dress sandals.\u00a0 Yet on following nights, we saw men in shorts, t shirts, flip flops, pool shoes, at various  other restaurants. Their random enforcement was a frustrating turnoff. At the beach buffet at lunch one day, a man in a tiny speedo and no shirt was allowed to sit at an inside table for lunch-ugh.", "-the lounge chair saving- again, the info sheet given at check-in, states\u00a0 you can't reserve loungers. Every day, I arrived at the beach just around 8am, to find the first 2 rows of palapas saved, with only 1-2 bodies there.", "The first day, when the towel hut opened, I  asked them about all the chairs saved, and were they going to remove belongings, and they brusquely said- go to guest services and fill out a survey. After 4 days of arriving the same time, and finding guests not arriving till 2-3 hours later, we went out at 7:15am and laid out our towels. When I came back, just 1/2 hour later after breakfast,  our and one other set of towels were removed- all the others were still there, with only a couple people there.\u00a0 Again, these people didn\u2019t show up till hours later. Later that day, we watched a confrontation when a man came up to that front row, demanding to know why they moved his belongings.", "We overheard them saying that staff removed towels only prior to 7:30. They came down at 6:30 and waited on their chairs, leaving at 7:30, knowing they wouldn't be moved.The resort should update their info sheet  to inform ALL guests of the specific  time that towels are removed, and enforce it unilaterally. We wondered many times if the VIP guests were given preferential treatment, in many areas of service.", "-their cocktail menu. It is VERY limited, and I was told at every bar that they have no mango( for mango martinis/daiquiris/margaritas),  and at the Caribe lobby bar, was told they had no chocolate (for a chocolate martini), and no cranberry (for a Cosmo). They didn\u2019t say they had run out, and would go get more- just that they did not have it. This is unacceptable for an all inclusive resort", "-Limited beach wait-service. We only saw a waiter on 3 days, and only after 3:30/4pm", "Other services/amenities we missed from other resorts:", "-Free Room service for all  guests", "-FreeTurndown service for all  guests", "-Daily activity sheet distributed, especially to inform in advance, which restaurants are closed", "-Free newspaper", "-Daily bingo", "-Live music in lobby before, during, after dinner hour for listening and dancing.", "-Acknowledgement of our 45th wedding anniversary, which I had mentioned in an email requesting a certain building, just prior to arriving.  There was no mention of it at check in, and I didn\u2019t say anything, thinking they would be surprising us with champagne in the room(they did not). The staff member was more interested in trying to upsell  to VIP, than explaining any services or amenities. The bellman who brought our luggage to the room (we were not escorted to the room)also made no effort to explain anything about it.", "After reading reports of people coming here dozens of times, and finding it perfect, my first thought is, \u2018have they been nowhere else?\u2019 We didn\u2019t feel the same, but, to each his own.

But there were a few things we expected coming here that just fell short.", "The food really wasn\u2019t good. I think the best meal I had the entire trip was a hamburger at the restaurant on the beach. The \u201csushi\u201d at this restaurant and the Asian restaurant really wasn\u2019t good, everything had cream cheese in it and the fish was not fresh. The meat at the steak place had a lot of fat in them, and quite frankly every single meal lacked flavor. The menus are standard Palladium group menus, but this resort just does not know how to make the food. The sandwiches are advertised with French bread or provolone cheese, and literally every single sandwich was made with a hot dog roll, peppers, and cheddar cheese. I\u2019ve been to 3 other all inclusive resorts, and the food at this one was the most disappointing.  The breakfast buffet was terrible, and the a la carte food was not much better. There are very few options for meals at this resort too. Had the food been better here, I\u2019d be more inclined to give it 3 stars. ", "The service was not good. We didn\u2019t hear from our butler often, others at our resort mentioned they got champagne and their room decorated for a birthday and we did not. Room service never came through so we had to ask at the end of day 2 if someone could restock our water and clean our room.  Once we did have room service, they didn\u2019t restock the snacks or water in our room for majority of our stay. We also attempted a la carte for breakfast twice and the first time we waited nearly 45 min before our food came, and when I asked if we could just go to the buffet instead we were told no no the food is coming. They basically forgot to put our order in.  The second time no one came to take our order so 20 min later I told the hostess we\u2019ll just go to the buffet instead. All in all we just didn\u2019t feel welcome and the staff did not seem to care to engage with the guests.  There seemed to be a disconnect between us since we are only English speaking.  We had asked for a drink menu at the lobby bar and were told they didn\u2019t have one, which is fine, but they kept pressuring us to order a drink when we had no idea what they made (they have fancy equipment to make what seemed like fancy drinks). The service just really was not up to par on what we were expecting from this nice of a resort.  I can\u2019t give this resort more than 2 stars because the food and lack of good service really made our experience disappointing. ", "The resort is very tiny, which is exactly what we wanted. Do not come here if you want a beach, there really isn\u2019t one. But the pools and layout of the resort is very nice. We really enjoyed our swim up room.  Also when our butler did reach out or we reached out to him, he did a great job of coming through and getting us whatever we asked for. The amenities and rooms are really great, we just had a poor experience in terms of food and service."]},

Now if you\u2019ve never stayed anywhere before or this is your first all inclusive OR you usually stay in 3*/4* resorts, then this is the place for you. If you\u2019re used to 5* service & grounds & food.. then do not come here. Before booking we were aware this resort wouldn\u2019t be what we were used to.. however we always booked resorts where the service was 5* however entertainment would end at 11pm and we\u2019d be completely bored at night (we\u2019re in our early 20\u2019s) so we thought let us try a \u201cparty resort\u201d", "ROOM;", "So on arrival, what was new was no one on this resort wore bracelets. There is no way of identifying if you\u2019re a guest or not or if you\u2019re from any other of the neighbouring resorts (there are about 3 other resorts next to breathless which guests there also have access to breathless facilities) .. we were given room cards and then taken to our room. First impression of the room was very outdated. Slight mouldy smell &  the shower head had limescale all over and the drain in the shower was loose .. I cut my foot on there. The room was big and the bed was nice and big too: you have a pillow menu as well however overall the room is a bland and unimpressionable space. A/C wasn\u2019t powerful and I woke up sweating a few times.. there is also a fan however the knob for the fan wasn\u2019t there so we had to use scissors or something to grip the dial to turn it on. TV was terrible and the lighting of the room was the most random .. the phone line was crackly and often hanged up in the middle of phone calls. There is a balcony every room has a hot tub but ours was dirty on arrival and filled with ants so we never used it. There are uncomfortable chairs and a table on the balcony too.. there is a full length mirror in the room, but besides that and a big room and a big bed, the room was disappointing.", "FOOD;", "Food I wasn\u2019t impressed with either. All edible but nothing significant. My bug bear was there is only the buffet open for lunch as a sit down.. which the food wasn\u2019t great at. There is the option of going to Now Onyx to eat at too. We tried all the restaurants but the Mexican because we don\u2019t like Mexican food. Again nothing that wowed us.", "We did get sick but not exactly applicable to everyone. We also went over to Now Onyx to try their a la cartes; I actually preferred the food there to Breathless a la cartes.

In the club we saw so many people request songs but the DJ usually ignored requests..

Music is repetitive and from top 40\u2019s decades ago ( Justin Beiber\u2019s - Baby isn\u2019t party music ) .. it was all techno jump around music which suited certain demographics ..

On one occasion we were out to dinner and I saw a cleaning cart and asked the lady if she didn\u2019t mind putting shower gel in our room. She said our room was not on her list (we were about 15 doors away) so I asked her for one and put it there myself.

By the end of the week it was much nicer.  The sand was very nice and there was a lot of shade if you needed it.  There was no drink service on the beach, but there were plenty of vendors; I would like to note that they were far less aggressive then the vendors the hotel allowed into the lobby.

The hotel supplied two cots (we requested) for our kids.  Unfortunately, there was few options at this resort as it was either you get cots, or you have two twin size beds.  I\u2019m 6\u20195 so that really isn\u2019t an option for me.   I want to be clear on one thing, there is zero privacy in these rooms, everything is open so to change you must go to the bathroom if the kids are in the room.  I didn\u2019t really like this as I have stayed at resorts in the past that offered more in the way of privacy.  The maid for our room did a great job every day and was always there very early for us.  The gentlemen filling the mini bar on two separate occasions did not show up, so we were not replenished with drinkable water for two straight days.

The hotel then upgraded all the guests and did literally nothing for us.  I went to the front desk to ask if they could offer and upgrade or just something to make our stay a little nicer as we paid almost $516 more than the other guests.  The hotel firmly stood by the stance that they just did something nice for everyone in the wedding group\u2026everyone but us.

", "Food- On almost literally every occasion my protein was overcook by a lot.  Meat was often tough or poorly seasoned.  It also offered little in the way of interesting variety as it was very much cheaper food.  I have never been to a resort where the only fruit they had were melons and pineapple.  God forbid we have berries or apples.  Cooked veggies were burnt or very undercooked.  The service at the La Hispaniola was spotty at best, many mornings I was forced to get my own water/coffee or find someone to set a place at a table.  Often, I would find the staff joking around with each other.  El Gaucho, was ran better and I enjoyed the staff there, including the one gentleman who was always singing.  This trickled in to the night where El Gaucho was very accommodating of a bachelor party we were having for the groom and we got great service.  Bella Pasta was also wonderful service and likely the best meal I had. ", "El Pescador was awful, the staff was slow, we ordered a bottle of wine, they only filled our glass once (when opened) and then we filled it every other time.  The staff completely abandoned us on the desert course, and they would never serve us again.  When we left, we found some of our servers outside joking with the hosts.  That was the only restaurant we did not tip. ", "Experience  ", "While on the beach the vendors where all very nice and not forceful, however in the main lobby they would often grab at you and bait your kids.  I have been to resorts before that have had vendors setup but never this aggressive.  Often, I felt uncomfortable and, on a few occasions, I had several vendors put their hands on me when I tried to walk away.  Other peddlers on the resort approached members of our party with illicit things. ", "Checkout ", "This went fine, though there was zero appreciate for our stay or any real mention of gratitude for spending $6500 and it was done quickly, when we boarded the tour bus (provided by Sunwing) we watched the men load the suitcases and then went to the airport.  When we got off the bus, they rushed us out the door and left quickly.  My mother in-law discovered that her bag wasn\u2019t there.  We contacted the hotel, from which the hotel blamed her for not watching the bag get loaded (which she did, I was standing next to her) and then said the only way to get the bag back was to pay $35 USD for a cab.  If she didn\u2019t have the money, \u201cno bag\u201d.  She agreed, and the bag was delivered (minus the taxi driver ripping her off another $10 USD by lying about the amount she gave him).  I have never had a hotel unwilling to ship a bag to a guest for free but that sums up what this resort was like.   ", "In conclusion ", "I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.  I felt like I was cheated out of much of my money and was unable to relax.  While travelling with younger children can be very stressful the staff failed to do anything notable to really endear myself to them."]},

{"hotel": ["Grand Memories Splash"], "title": ["Beware the Doctors office"], "content": ["I took my wife and three kids to Memories splash on the first week of April, overall the resort was terrific. But beware of the doctors office on the resort it is a total scam and if you try to talk to the resort or Sunwing you are told that there is nothing they can do to help you. My 6 year old daughter had something in her eye had kept complaining that she couldn't see and that it hurt so we decided to go to the doctors office located on the resort. The first thing you will notice is the presence of several security guards dressed in what looked like military style attire, sitting and standing inside and outside the office. We step inside where the \"doctor\" inspected my daughter and told us that she had a serious eye infection and that it needed to be treated right away. She asked us if we had insurance which we did and she preceded to explain that she was just the \"triage\" between the resort and the hospital. She said that she didn't have the necessary medication needed to help my daughter and insisted that it needed immediate attention. She had my wife call the insurance company to make sure they would cover the hospital visit and had me retrieve our passport and $100 cash. She called a taxi which drove my wife and daughter 15 minutes away for the $50, to a clinic not a hospital. My wife and daughter sat in an empty waiting room for several hours (I think to inflate the cost) until my wife demanded to see the doctor. The doctor took less than 5 minutes to tell my wife that my daughter did not have an eye infection but if she wanted they would give her eye drops. My wife told her why would I give her eye drops if you are telling me there is nothing wrong with her eye. The doctor said just to make us feel better, whatever that means. I am of the opinion that they just wanted something else to bill the insurance with. So as my wife and daughter attempted to leave the clinic, she was stopped by a very rude and pushy administrator that refused to let her leave until she paid $900. My wife told them that she had insurance coverage, to which he insisted that she call them to have the money sent to them. He said that it would take a couple of hours. First of all there is no reception so her cell phone wouldn't work so she couldn't call me who was anxiously waiting at the resort with my two younger children much less the insurance. They finally allowed her to use their phone while rudely muttering something in his language. The insurance company told her that they never process applications that quickly and that it could take months before the bill would be covered and paid for by them. I am sure the clinic knew this before they had her call because obviously they have been in this situation many times before with other tourists that have the misfortune of being carted over to the clinic. So the end of it is my wife paid with her credit card so that she could just leave, it had after all been 4 hours since they had left the resort. Of course the taxi ride back cost another $50 and by the way my wife noticed that they passed the actual hospital that was less then 10 minutes away on the way back to the resort. My daughters eye cleared up on its own while she was still in the hospital. They got back to our room at nearly 2 am in the morning, which was outrageous. They should be ashamed of themselves taking advantage of people who are foreign to the country and putting them in hostage like situations where their only way out is to fork over tons of money. Interesting side note my wife noticed that all the \"clients\" they had at this clinic were tourists from the resort who were also all being scammed and intimidated. Many of whom were surrounded by security when they protested their treatment.  Shame on all the doctors, administration, security and even the taxi drivers involved in this outrageous treatment of resort guests in their time of need. Shame the Grand Memories Splash and Sunwing for allowing this to continue."]},

We asked for 3 days for wash cloths & dry creamer in our room and finally received both on day 4. We stayed on the Adult Only side and it didn't even have a swim-up bar or any activities during the day around the pool.  One day they had music which consisted of a horn player playing basically quite elevator music.  We are a young 50'ish aged couple who are used to all-inclusives that provide at least adult-type activity in the afternoon around the pool - at this resort there was none.  We walked over to the Place and they were all having lots of fun with pool games and they actually had a swim-up bar !! Imagine that music and a swim-up bar where the kids are but none at the adults only pool.  Very disappointing.  Also, there is only 1 place to get lunch at the Adults Only resort and if you try and walk into the restaurant from the pool or the beach you won't get in with a damp bathing suit and no shoes - where do they expect you to eat??  All other places we've traveled had a large grille section on the beach with dogs, burgers, chicken, etc for lunch for those who are either lounging at the pool or on the beach during the lunch time.  Also you can't bring one morsel of food out of the restaurants - so don't think you can snatch a burger and take it out to the pool or onto the beach - wasn't happening. We were sold an \"all-inclusive\" package only to be told that we could only eat at 5 of the restaurants or we would have to pay !!!  Imagine that having to pay to eat at an all-inclusive. Also know in advance that they watered down ever drink our group ordered. Ever single one - by the 4th day we caught on and would order a shot of whatever alcohol in addition to the cocktail that we ordered.  This has never happened at a Rui or an Iberostar and we've stayed at them all.  All in all our group was EXTREMELY disappointed in this resort.  We all gave the grounds an A for beauty but a  C Grade for the food since most nights the dinners were horrible.  I notice on the ratings that Sandy P, Director General of Barcelo Bravaro Beach only responds to complimentary reviews but I truly welcome her response.

It seems that the Dominican people are far behind many places in respect of preserving their wonderful country, hopefully a better education programme can help going forward.", "We had three main negative issues, which we discussed with Manuela, and which we are confident will be addressed for the future.", "1) the use of Bluetooth speakers and other devices in public zones.  Obviously in this tech age, most people own such a device - I certainly do.  I used mine in our room whilst changing for dinner etc, and enjoyed doing so.  However, out of common courtesy, I wouldn\u2019t dream of inflicting my choice of music on everyone else around a quiet pool area.  Unfortunately a number of people were not as considerate, and on several days the noise was horrendous. Imagine if everyone used their devices at once - chaos!  On top of that, because they were playing music, the same people then had to shout above the volume to others in their group - the result resembled a kid\u2019s playground. As many other reviewers have noted, this is not a party resort, so if that is your preference, perhaps a little research would help. We had a nasty experience with a young woman (can\u2019t call her a lady) in the next room playing loud music.  When my husband, who was unwell, asked her if she could turn the volume down, she replied with a torrent of abuse, including the worst kind of swearing, that she was on her vacation and could do what she wanted.  Clearly our vacation enjoyment wasn\u2019t important.....", "2) the consumption of food in the pools and hot tubs. One question - why is this necessary?  To those people who thought it a good idea, do you seriously like the idea of swimming  in pizza and nachos? Also, to the man smoking a big cigar in the middle of the pool, please take an ashtray with you...", "3) abuse of dress code. This is a 5- star resort which sells itself on elegance and extremely high quality customer care.  Is it really so difficult to respect the dress code? There are already 2 restaurants where smart shorts are allowed, but we saw many people in shorts using other eateries with the stricter code. Yes, I know this is everyone\u2019s holiday/vacation, but given that the dress standards are listed everywhere, surely it\u2019s not too difficult to pack a couple of pairs of long trousers, and respect the ethos of the resort, and those guests who like a more sophisticated experience?  ", "All in all, the notion of a little respect for others would go a long way.  The people who go ahead and simply please themselves can, however inadvertently, or in many cases deliberately, spoil other\u2019s enjoyment - how is that fair?  We have all paid good money to stay at this wonderful resort, what is wrong with respecting others\u2019 space and points of view, to ensure that everyone has a good time?", "Okay, enough negativity/ constructive criticism.  What the hotel gets right every time are;", "Food and beverages - never had a bad meal, loads of choice, fresh and beautifully served, to a very high standard. House wine was perfectly palatable, we saw no need to pay extra for the wine list. Our top choices were Chez Isabelle and Magna, but we tried them all and were never disappointed. Drinks were fine, although we were a little surprised that for over 2 weeks of our stay there was no Cassis at any of the bars. Room minibar was always well stocked, and the lovely guy with the cart made sure we had exactly what we wanted, including ensuring that the bottles of spirit provided were to our own choice. Room service was excellent.", "Room - clean and comfortable, had everything and more that we needed.", "Entertainment - perfect to dip in and out of, although on our 3-week holiday things got a little repetitious, but credit to EPC for providing a focal point for guests to gather and either watch the entertainment or sit in a quieter area and enjoy a drink.  We enjoyed the occasional \u201cquieter\u201d game at the Excellence pool, which suited the ambience ; we were very pleased to be far away from the sometimes manic games at the main pool area, which we saw as we walked along the beach.  So if noise, music etc are your thing, you know where to go.", "Waiter service - this was consistently good, whether around the pools / beach during the day, in the restaurants or in the public areas in the evenings. Also the pool concierges were very attentive and helpful. ", "Hotel grounds and beach - just stunning. Full credit to the gardeners and maintenance staff, they work so hard to keep EPC looking immaculate. We also loved wandering in the eco-park, and feeding the animals - my husband loved the parrot sitting on his arm dismantling almonds, and the flamingoes taking bread out of his hand - paradise!", "A few mentions - there were so many members of staff who helped make our holiday memorable, unfortunately we didn\u2019t get all of their names, but suffice it to say that the hotel should be proud of every one of them. ", "Hendruix, pool concierge - don\u2019t forget the sunscreen! Luchi, Yohanna, Gabriela, Kendrie, Reynaldo at the Excellence and Cascade pools. Restaurants; Elezior (hope that\u2019s the correct spelling) Stephanie and Randell  (Magna), Oney (the Grill), Dolores and Jossy (Oregano), Christian at the Kitchen Table, who was always attentive, and who kept his staff aware of what was going on at all times. Ruth, the hostess who seemed to be everywhere.  \u201cYummy yummy\u201d men Cesarin, Richard and Ynocensio kept us fed at lunchtime, and also in the restaurants in the evening. Entertainment: Nicki Minaj, Luis (Coca Cola), Joanna and Junior. And last but by no means least, Mitherlina, our room maid, who was so sweet and efficient, and who left us towel art many times - a huge thank you to you all.", "All in all we had a wonderful holiday, the weather was glorious throughout, and we met some fantastic people, with whom it was a pleasure to chat and spend some time. Our wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday were made very special - our anniversary meal on the beach was beautiful, room service breakfast in bed was exceptional, and the champagne flowed throughout my husbands birthday.  The pool concierges even tied balloons around our pool parasol and decorated the lounger with flowers, such a nice touch.", "Would we recommend? Yes, with no hesitation.  Will we be back? It would be nice to think so.  Thank you, EPC, and good luck to Manuela in your new post."]},
{"hotel": ["Excellence Punta Cana"], "title": ["Best Vacation Trip Ever!!!!"], "content": ["Firstly, lets began that this review will not even be close to of explaining how magical, incredible this resort treated my girlfriend and me for our anniversary! When booking this trip I already had reviewed many reviews to know what I'm investing my money in, but it was beyond my expectations. We were upgraded to an ocean view swim out suite without asking, which was our favorite part of the trip(our room). Also, our check-in guy Matis called to make sure we loved the room and offered us the anniversary package as well free of charge. He asked during our check in what brought us to Punta Cana and told him it was our anniversary thinking nothing of it, and he went out his way to make it very special. He really made our trip a once in lifetime trip with the anniversary package and upgraded room. We loved the ocean view and outside lounge bed.  It was beautiful! Full mini bar that was stock daily and Danny boy noticed I mainly drank the Presidente light, which were very good, and he added extra in our suite without us asking. He was very sweet and always spoke to me and my girlfriend when we seen him in passing. There are so many activities on the resort that you don't even need to book excursions if you don't want. There is so much to see and do that you will be able to relax and still be active on the resort. There is a botanical garden entering the resort and an ecological park(another garden) at the back, both with several ponds, water fountains, and birds to feed bread. There is housekeeping and turn down service at night, which I never experience, where they pretty much get everything ready for you for bed. This was a great extra touch because I had my bottled water and slippers by the bed. The bars and pools were amazing! We didn't book the excellence club, but we didn't feel like we miss anything. All the action was at the main pool by the lobby, and even if you don't participate it's nice to watch on your way to the ice cream shop or anywhere else. The Coca Cola guy that is part of the hype team really gets the crowd pumped and kept us entertained. That role is perfect for him. When watching the bachata lessons from a distance he screamed on the microphone calling out my Puerto Rican girlfriend to come dance, which she brought me. We had a blast and it made us feel special. Tried many restaurants, many items I liked and some were just not for me, but hey that is the great thing about all inclusives. I'll just get something different. Everyone was so nice and polite, saying hola and speaking to us everywhere we went. The shows were great too. I read many reviews that people said they were \"outdated\", but they weren't at all. The dancers weren't making any mistakes, played great music, and hag great energy! We have pictures to last a lifetime, but I'm sure we will back in the near future. Thank you Excellence Punta Cana for making our a once in a lifetime memory. I wish I can click my heels three times and be back. The trip was excelente!"]},

{"hotel": ["Excellence Punta Cana"], "title": ["Wonderful Wedding Week"], "content": ["This trip was our second time to the Excellence Punta Cana.  Our original trip was to test out the resort for the wedding we planned for this past April.  After our visit we were excited to have our wedding on resort and we counted down the days.", "Finally the date arrived and for this trip, we came down for 10 days and brought 44 of our closest friends and family to help us celebrate.  It was the most wonderful week we could have imagined!  ", "From the resort itself to the many staff that made us all feel like we were \"home\".  Our wedding coordinator Johanny, had been helping us for over a year with all of the details for our ceremony and reception and was awesome.  She was always very responsive via email and once we were on resort, she went through everything with us down to the minute detail so it was all exactly what we wanted.  She was also staged at the various locations on our wedding day and as the night went on, to make sure that we had everything that we needed as soon as possible.  We actually chose to have our wedding before our trip so we wouldn't have to worry about any paperwork getting lost or forgotten, and so we could use a family friend as our officiant.  We chose the stone gazebo on the south side of the resort and it was beautiful.  The only issue was the lack of wind which made for a very hot ceremony!  But it was worth it based on the pictures.  Our reception in the Lobster House (which was closed for the night)  was also beautiful and we couldn't have pictured a more unbelievable location if we tried.  If you are thinking of having your wedding here, you are in great hands with Johanny and Yessica!", "The resort itself was stunning as usual.  Every detail was taken care of including the seaweed that occasionally made it's way to the beach.  They always had a crew working hard to remove anything that washed ashore and keep the beach area beautiful.  The second we arrived, Abraham our bell hop grabbed our bags and got us checked in quickly and easily.  He also was willing to help us with anything and was always available when we needed him.  For our stay, we chose the two story Club suite with the rooftop terrace and it was unbelievable.  If you haven't seen a tour online, take the time to look it up. The views alone are breathtaking, from the ocean and club pool to the front, to the mountains and cascade pool to the rear where our room was located in building 2. The room was huge and we used the rooftop terrace to entertain our group throughout our stay.  The plunge pool was a hit on those warm afternoons when you just needed to cool off for a few.  Although we probably wouldn't get a room like this if it was just us, it was just right for what we needed this time.  The only drawback was that occasionally the minibar staff was slow to refill our liquor and soda, but all it took was a quick call or a visit to the club desk and they were right on it.  They were also great with our special requests whenever we had them from extra mixers to swapping out liquors.", "On the beach, the service was also top notch with Reynaldo and Hendruix providing great service and some awesome entertainment.  And our trips to the swim up bar, Blue, was also great whenever Willy and Pedro were bartending.  The shots they came up with whenever we asked never disappointed.", "For our group, we booked the Club swimup suites that surrounded the cascade pool as well as additional rooms in the Club area to create a central hub for everyone.  It worked out perfectly.  Since we had booked all of the swimup suites, we were able to take over the upper pool and have a great time without bothering anyone else.  And Jhon, the bartender/server for the cascade pool bar was awesome.  Whenever we were out on the patios or in the pool, he made his way to us to take drink and food orders and got us whatever we needed all day long.  He was fantastic!", "The restaurants on the resort were great as well.  The food for the most part was great as always with only a couple small hiccups, which are to be expected anywhere.  Our favorites were Chez Isabelle, the Grill and Magna.  The beef tenderloin in Chez and the ribeye in the Grill were phenomenal and were ordered more than once.  Adan in Magna was our waiter for numerous breakfasts and set up a wonderful dinner for 4 in which he took care of all of the ordering(surf and turf) and set us up with wine and dessert.  We never asked for the dinner, he just wanted to do something nice for our group.  He did a great job.", "Overall, our trip and wedding couldn't have been more perfect.  It was such a treat to see all of the people in our group be blown away by the resort itself and the level of service that the staff provides.  And we can't say enough about Santa the general manager.  There were a few times when we had issues with rooms and she did everything in her power to help us as quickly as possible.  Also, a couple of times when the group got a little too crazy, she came to my wife and myself to explain the issue so we could address it without any problems.  She was fantastic in every way and we would come back just because of her!  She was so great that we invited her to our reception so we could thank her in person.  Unfortunately, she had some issues that came up and couldn't make it.", "To sum up this long-winded review, the resort was unbelievable from the grounds to the staff.  Our wedding was everything that we hoped it would be and went off without a hitch.  Getting married here was a great choice.  Santa and the Club staff made everything so relaxing and effortless and we look forward to making this a regular trip going forward.  You can't go wrong here!"]},

But then we were told we had to sit through a timeshare presentation .  But overall the check in staff were very welcoming . Andy, Helped us to our rooms two of them were next to each other 2158 and 2160 . My room 2158 the fridge was empty and he called right away to have it filled up . He also brought up my fathers stuff to his room which was 2439 . The first night was pretty cool , we went to carnival for dinner . Was a pretty descent Buffet and the workers were great . We went to the beach party and it was cool , But didn't realize there was another stage with the DJ instead of the live entertainment.   The next day we went pool side which was nice very hot . The pool was great but the cups that they use to serve the drinks in make everything taste funny . Unless you were a preferred member you couldn't get a can or a glass cup . But we were able to work our magic and get cans and the glass cups. Omar , was amazing at filling up the minibars . He was very attentive and called to make sure I had everything I needed .  Algeni , the security that was by my room everyday was very delightful . He stood there all day was very knowledgeable of the area and to move around . He was very pleasant and always asked if he can do something for me . That man deserves  a raise . Now as for the restaurants to start it off the \"SHOW\" at SPICE was horrible . We had a 45 minute wait for a \"show\" and the person was far from entertainment . He seemed as if he was bothered to be there . The customer service was very disappointing . The buffet was nice but wish they would have switched up the menu a bit . Was very repetitive . Also would've liked to have food from the island . Taste the good culture . I do understand that you pay for certain perks when you opt to get the Preferred package but I think for the people who don't want to be VIP they can do a bit better . I asked for a frozen drink at the pool bar and I got a watery slushy . They had a blender but didn't put it to use , was a bit disappointing . Its like one of those expectation versus Reality . Again The Hotel was beautiful but i think their could be a lot of improvements with the food and restaurants . But the housekeepers and the guys who restocked the minibars were amazing ! A big shout out to I believe her name was Mercedes. We mentioned it was my sisters 35th birthday and she was stuck in a wheelchair during this trip in an accident that happened a few weeks prior and she set up the room with balloons . She was amazing !  I hope that this review does come in handy . Hopefully the hotel makes some changes Id like to go back to this resort with the improvements and not have to pay for preferred . Id rather tip the hard workers !"]},

I was a guest of my friend who had booked the trip and it was a nice resort. I typically stay at adult only resorts so this was a bit different for me. The rooms were fine, needed some updating all around the property. As soon as we checked in I wanted to take a shower and it was broken. It was fixed in a timely manner and was fine for the rest of my stay. Room service was great. The main dining room was very outdated and not at all comfortable in my opinion. The food was adequate, not bad not great. I had a treatment at the spa and it was nice. The best part was soaking in the hot tub, and the hydro therapy pool. I don't remember his name but the attendant at the spa pool was outstanding. He was helpful, attentive and checked on me regularly. We had a bath/hot tub in our room but I really wanted to soak in a hot tub under the tropical evening. There was not one hot tub available after dark. I personally don't want to sit in a hot tub in the hot day hours, but at night, yes please! This is something they should consider offering. I also wanted to go for a swim one night but that is also not available during the evening. Very disappointing. Overall this was a nice resort but nothing special. "]},

The biggest criticisms I have are over the food (it was good, not great), the beach is very small (wasn\u2019t an issue for us but they do provide transportation to a VIP section at a larger beach area in another resort (though you need to pay for food and drinks(?) there at reduced prices)), and the lack of communication from staff to guests (due to low occupancy they had to reduce restaurant options for breakfast and lunch but that was not communicated to guests until we tried to avail of one of the options).  Aside from that, the rooms are clean and relatively large, drink ware is all glass (not plastic), liquor selection is quite good (they even had Crown Royal), towels were large and fluffy, staff were amazing, wifi was provided, free transportation was available to shopping areas, it is a smaller resort, and it was fairly low key (just what we were looking for).

Pools closed around 6 or 7.", "The food was the only thing that seemed sorely lacking. Breakfasts were decent if you just had eggs from the omelette bar and got the fresh cut fruit.  We found meals at lunch and dinner disappointing.  We always had a 15 or 20 minute wait for tables regardless of how busy it was.  It was our first time at an all inclusive and had been told to expect the food to be just above an Olive Garden level of quality.

{"hotel": ["Breathless Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Good for what it advertises, sub-par for everything else"], "content": ["We stayed here May 4-11, 2019. We had really enjoyed All-Inclusive resorts before, and this was our third - ours others being Sandals La Source in Grenada, and Secrets Aura in Cozumel. We're an adventurous couple who love to scuba dive, and these vacations allow us the best of both tropical worlds - dive in the morning, relax, drink and play during the afternoon and night. ", "Since this is marketed as a social resort, we were looking to meet more couples like us - early thirties, adventurous, athletic, not content to just sit in the pool and drink all day. Unfortunately this resort is not what we were looking for in that regard. Breathless advertises its party and social aspects very well and very accurately, but that sort of partying is not what we were looking for. Each day in the pools we encountered large groups of loud, drunk parties looking to get the most out of the open bars. This, at least, was god for people-watching but since my wife and I are not especially outgoing people, this kind of atmosphere left us feeling more isolated than included. ", "As for the diving, it turns out the local dive shop is a 40-minute shuttle drive away. Our last 2 resorts had a dock and a boat come to pick us up, so we were not used to this kind of commuter-diving, but we got used to it after a day or two and it wasn't too bad. Still, we'll be sure to do more research on the resort location from now on when it comes to diving. The shop, SeaPro, was very friendly and we had a large series of excellent dives. The wildlife wasn't much to write home about, but the caves and wrecks were. ", "As for service, we were constantly taken for emotional highs and lows when it came to the quality and consistency of the service we were offered at the resort. For some things, like the phone not having a loud enough call volume, they sent someone immediately. For others, like our sheets constantly smelling like they'd been left in the washing machine for too long before drying, and one of our cabinet doors falling off, they didn't fix them at all. The room overall was fine and we didn't have any complaints about it aside from those mentioned. ", "(Also, for the most relaxing nap of your life, spent the morning out in the sun and then come back to the room and put on Channel 5 - Ashes and Snow, then fall asleep to it. Trust me, it's excellent.)", "The daily printed schedule turned out to be completely useless to us, as every time we tried to show up for an event that was listed, the event wasn't happening or was 30 minutes late. We love playing volleyball, and when we showed up on the first day for the scheduled 11am session, they didn't even have the net up. We tried to find someone to ask them about it, and they told us they typically didn't even bother with the morning events because everyone's hung over. Well, why even have a schedule printed, then? One day the court was closed due to an event being set up on the beach, another it simply didn't happen at all with no explanation, etc. etc. This kind of thing happened to us for virtually everything we tried, from volleyball to the foam party to yoga to spanish lessons to restaurants. Sometimes we were lucky and caught something we wanted to do, and then noted that it was at a completely different time than advertised. It became sort of a running joke for us. ", "Speaking of restaurants, overall, they were OK. Again, specific restaurants closed randomly at times not noted on the schedule, and in one case, Kibbeth, it never opened at all the entire time we were there. The buffet, Spoon, actually doesn't have a seating area of its own, so it needs to take over the adjacent joined restaurants to allow people to sit and eat. For us, the fabled Kibbeth never materialized, which was a shame since we love Mediterranean food and were looking forward to that especially. Our favorite was the Continential - truly amazing food and the best service we had all week. ", "The Mexican restaurant, Picante, was great but super popular - every night we tried to get a table, we were told a wait of 30-60 minutes. Eventually we wised up to this and put our name in early, then went and got drinks in the lobby for an hour. Still, this was also the case for most of the restaurants we tried, although most had not quite as long a wait. In the case of Silk City, the asian/hibachi restaurant, we waited a half-hour only to be let into the restaurant's \"waiting area\", where we waited yet another 20 minutes before being seated.", "We're sure the nightlife and night entertainment was great, but since we dove every morning we typically didn't stay up past 11, which is when this resort really appears to come alive. If you're into that kind of thing, you'll likely enjoy it far more than we did. ", "We tried the Spa, which I would rate as Very Good. Although the massage itself was fairly standard and we didn't get any chance to tell them to work on particular areas more strongly, every massage comes with a 1-hour hydrotherapy session where you are guided through a steam room, sauna, ice cold bath, hot tub, and relaxing pool waterfall. All of this really helped get us in the mood for the massage and I'd really recommend it. ", "For the most part, the staff was very courteous and helpful - although knowledge of Spanish will definitely help you here since many of the staff can't speak very good English, or have a very (very) thick accent. We found this was especially the case with our shuttle drivers to the dive shop every day - several spoke no English at all. We didn't encounter any negative attitudes at all, save for the woman answering the room service phone - she was very irritable, but I can imagine handling room service orders for drunk people all night (I called at 11pm) would certainly get anyone frustrated after a while. Everyone else was super friendly and mostly helpful. ", "In conclusion - for what we were looking for, this resort did not deliver. We don't party especially hard, and we weren't with a group so it was hard to be particularly social when everyone else seemed to be very drunk and in their own circles most of the time. We found the service to be completely hit or miss, particuarly when it came to the printed schedule and the dining services. The diving, while good, required commuting in a van for 30-40 minutes each way over Dominican roads. These roads, while well-maintained, contain an absolutely ridiculous number of speed bumps, which caused my wife to get slightly carsick each time we went. Plus it seems the driving in the DR is much more intense than what we're used to in the US, and the vans are all speeding everywhere trying to get their clients to their destinations on time.

Racial profiling.  Then day before we left me and my daughter were going to dinner and got stopped 3rd time for room card while walking. Very insulting for this to happen for no reason when guards were not stopping other people. We were well dressed and both of us are quite shy women.  Had to be because we were african american.  All the restaurants were overly crowded and we were not able to eat at most except buffett and Japanese where we made reservations.  I paind 3,500 US dollars for 5 nights.  Definitely not worth it.  Staff very friendly.  Other guest that I talked to had other complaints like food and conditions of the rooms.  Maids didn't stock room with towels on 2 occasions.  Comforters on bed were wet.  Worst part we contracted bed bugs from the beds.  Had to see a doc when we got back to U.S.  Never had bed bugs b4.Exterminator came on the day we were checking out to spray the room but we didn't call them so must have been problems with rooms."]},

Fedelisa was my absolute favorite server there and she was quick to remember many guests names and their preferred drink orders. She is so friendly and greats everyone with a warm beautiful smile. My only concern of the resort was the medical service that the resort offers. On my last day, a guest suffered a heart attack and I went to assist since I\u2019m an EMT. The medical staff lacked some basic supplies such as oxygen in their oxygen tank, or the proper tubing to provide oxygen. I would not say that the staff was incompetent as the head Security Officer, Albert, was quick to assist me with chest compressions and did a phenomenal job. I just hope this is a learning experience for the med staff to properly inventory their medical equipment to accommodate and respond properly to any medical emergencies.

Went down to the front desk on Friday and they told us if it wasn't fixed by Saturday evening they would switch rooms. They did send someone up Saturday and I watched what he did, he turned the breaker off and back on. Said it would be working in 10 minutes. Like I said all he did was flick the breaker and make it seem like he did something. I'm not a push over and am very familiar with basic electrical and maintenance. Just something to try to shut us up. Went back down to get out rooms switched but then said they were too full and could switch our rooms and nothing they could do for us. Normally not a complainer but in 30 degree heat with no a/c for a full week wasn't acceptable. The rest of the resort was okay but by no means a 4 star. I could keep going on and on but an honest review is a 2 star only, could be so much more if the management actually cared about there guests and not just about getting people in and out to fill the owner's and their pockets.

We didn't have any poblem with that because that place was 100% better than the other. When we got to Impressive Resort the next day (April 21st) at noon, we have to wait until 3pm to do our check in, everything ok until then. It was 3pm and we waited 3 hours and 25 minutes to have our room, we booked 2 King bed rooms for me and my friends, at 6:25pm they gave us our rooms and they were not the ones we booked from  the beginning, so we were wasting time in the lobby since 3pm until 6:30pm to NOT HAVE the rooms we ordered. I fill my complain with the manager and they offer us an upgrade to \"premium\" services, we accepted because we thought it was gonna make it up for the bad momento we were going thru, WRONG. The only difference with est\u00e1ndar and premium services was the free wifi that they are supposed to give you on your rooms, It didn't work in the whole staying we had there. We wanted to enjoy the pool the next day and they didn't had any towels for us, they were out of it. FYI: they close the pool at 6pm, so the day we got there and we waited 3 and 25minutes for our rooms, we didn't even enjoy the pool, it was all dark and we couldn't enjoy the beach also. My Friends and I worked really hard and waited with so much excitement this trip, it was just going to be 4 days of relax and it was not like that AT ALL. I do not recomend this Resort because even the people on the lobby were not giving me an answer for nothing. This was my 2nd time in Punta Cana and I never had a bad experience like this before, I have to say that the only person that helped me in this whole problem was Jhoan the guy who receives the complaints at the resort.

The resort is totally beautiful and look exactly like the pictures. One of their greatest assets is the people who work at the resort and their willingness to try to please the guests. If you are looking for a laid back smaller resort to unwind from a stressful life or job, this is the place for you. If you are a party until the wee hours of the morning type, this is not the place for you. The reason that I gave it 3 1/2 stars is because they are going through the growing process of a newly opened resort. The beach area is not good right now because of the seaweeds and the fishy smell, but they do have a free shuttle to a nice beach. We were pleased with Juan our Butler because he went out of his way to make sure our Anniversary celebration went well. I would suggest that they hire more bilingual help because we had to deal with a lot of miscommunication when it came to ordering food from the room service people or the restaurants. On a number of occasions we got the wrong food orders from both. The bartenders need training because they can't make simple mixed drinks like a Margarita. I have been to a lot of resorts all over the Caribbean, Hawaii and Mexico, so I can say that they need to improve the menu and the food preparation. The food is average at best so far. I hope this is helpful because I am being as honest as possible, but we all know that our opinions is ours and it depend on our experiences.  "]},

I would much prefer arriving and heading right to my room. Sitting there for a half hour after traveling is not what i want to do.  The place is huge. The beach is beautiful and the excursions are fun.  We did the party boat/snorkeling because we did not want to travel far for an excursion and we also didn't want to be gone all day.  There was a coconut \"party\" on the beach, a beach party etc. The party pool is great as well as the \"quiet\" pool.  The service throughout the entire resort was outstanding.

I tried putting my a/c on 68 but it would not go below 70 in the room.  I was fine during the day, if we were getting ready to go out but at bed time i like it cooler so I can be under the blankets.  My friend had an upgrade to exhale.  I didn't really see the perk in the upgrade besides being able to have lunch at \"The Strip\"  I thought service was better at the regular beach.  ", "We did not like the food.  I couldn't find much that I liked.  I had the scallops from Culinaria which I was not a fan of.  My husband had the lamb which he said was okay.  The buffet was awful. Breakfast or dinner we did not care for it at all.  Silk city (hibachi) was good. Rice, steak, chicken and shrimp. The strip was decent too.  I had a filet and my husband had a teriyaki salmon that was good.  We headed over to Onyx to try the Bluewater grill.  That was my favorite. I had salmon that was good.   The grill near the beach is awful and the room service is bad too.  Twice we got fruit from the cafe and twice there was bad fruit in it.  ", "I really enjoyed the Rock show since it was different music. The singers weren't great but we're at a resort in a different country so what do you expect.  At least the songs were different and a lot of people sang along making it fun.  They are very repetitive with their music at the shows and at the club.  The songs could be changed up a bit.  Other than the food being awful we had a great time.  If you're looking for a party this is def the place to go. Foam parties, swim up bars, djs in the morning, dj on the beach, etc.  I would not go back here since we have now been here but I would def try Breathless in Cancun or somewhere else."]},

We assumed we would get this upon check-out but in fact should have received \"coupons\" upon check-in. I guess they were too busy upon check-in trying to up-sell us to the Diamond club, which is not worth the fees, to give us the coupons.  Our room was nice, clean and was in a great location close to Bubbles pool, the buffet and badminton.  The rooms had a smell of a mildewed or moldy air filter.  We found this in the stores and the gym had the worst of this smell.  The gym is SUPER SMALL.  The water park is awesome for kids of all ages.  The beach is very small and chairs are at a premium, same goes at the pool.  The area of the resort is very poor, not uncommon on an island.  We went on an excursion to another part of the island that had gorgeous calm turquoise water and powder sand beaches with tons of beach front vastly different from the Memories beach. The water is very wavy, the kids enjoyed boogie boards and older kids and adults used stand up pedal boards which were fun both free.  Some activities on the beach cost money, but many were unavailable when we went due to the holiday.  We ate at the Italian restaurant at Memories, I loved my pasta, but the other 7 diners did not enjoy their meals.  We paid $100 to eat at the Chinese restaurant which was not good, and we had to wait to be seated despite our reservation and the restaurant was empty! The Japanese restaurant, we again paid $100 to dine there, was the best food we had all week, but our hibachi chef was LAME while other chefs put on a great shows ours just cooked in front of us.  We had fun singing karaoke at the sports bar and enjoyed the Michael Jackson show.  The buffet, we never had good service here.  Had to beg for tea/coffee and cocktails yet they expect tips for literally no service.  The food was the same every day at every meal.  The Italian lunch buffet that we found on our last day was lovely.  We dined outside and enjoyed a better variety of food and good service.  We attended the white party which was fun but loud and the side rolled so far in there was almost no space to dance or move.  We stayed Tuesday-Easter Sunday.  Tuesday-Friday we felt the pools were surrounded with families all enjoying their vacation. Then on Saturday it was like a bunch of partiers showed up.  There was a fun foam party at the main pool which is the louder events pool fun for a few days then nice to have the quieter bubbles pool with Fabio the bar tender who is the only server that gave us excellent consistent service.  The foam party was cut short for us because one of the newly arrived partiers that were chugging drinks and smoking Hookah  threw-up IN THE POOL.  We were so grossed out.  The staff handled it well, but it was just not the scene you want your children exposed to.  Overall, for all of the tipping we did in an attempt to obtain good service we were left feeling broke and underwhelmed."]},

Since we last visited in May of 2017, the resort has greatly improved! (although we didn't have any issues our first visit) We traveled as a family with one child age 10, and she had the best time this year!! We definitely plan to return next year not only because of many reasons including the friendly, attentive staff, the kids accommodations, value and ease of travel.", "Check-in", "Our check in process was seamless, we were greeted with cold beverages, and we were escorted to our room within a total of ten minutes from actually stepping off of our bus via golf cart. Reyna explained everything as well as provided us with open dining options and wifi password. We declined any additional information as we had already spent a week here before.", "Dining", "We stayed at the Royalton Hideaway in Jamaica last year and our service in the specialty restaurants here was comparable! During Good Friday and the Saturday before Easter the resort had to be at maximum capacity as the volume in the restaurants including the buffet was insane and they lacked service, but I just think there was way too many people. All of the workers were working very hard to keep everyone happy, and we are very easy to please people so it didn't bother us one bit! We don't expect exceptional service at the buffet and the waiters exceeded our expectations by always offering us beverages and clearly plates promptly. We ate at all of the specialty restaurants, and we had exceptional service every time. I apologize that I do not remember all of our waiters names, but Eddy at the Italian restaurant I do remember and he was the best! He effortlessly multitasked a decent amount of families and he never missed a thing. He cleared, pre-coursed, re-coursed and came back throughout our dining experience to offer beverages to compliment every step of our dinner. Eddy's service definitely exceeded our expectations by far!! We have stayed at a handful of other resorts over the years and I believe that the food here is overall the best! They have a lot of people to please coming from different cultures, and worst case scenario they will get you something else if you don't care for something!! Also of note, every specialty restaurant has a kids menu with the basics: chicken fingers, pizza, hot dog, hamburger, and the buffet has a lowered area with stereos for children to help themselves which I thought was convenient!", "Kids club", "Santo was so soft spoken and wonderful at the kids club. This is the first year that we actually left our daughter with the staff, and we literally had to beg her to leave to come to dinner with us! Throughout the week, we made it a routine to take her there around 1-2pm so her fair skin could get a break from the sun and we could have some alone time. She made great friends there, and she would then meet them after dinner at the show as well! The staff also had activities like face painting, movie night and an Easter egg hunt free of charge. ", "Bars", "We received great service and delicious drinks at all of the bars. Ramon and his coworkers took care of us at the pool bar. Elio and Leondria (spelling?) took amazing care of us at the social bar, where we could sit and watch the show as well as our child as she went from kids club to arcade to show; it was ideal! We ventured to the Royalton side a handful of times and had THE best martinis from the martinis bar outside of the sports bar from Christian and Daniel!", "Beans Cafe", "The coffee shop on Memories was not my favorite, but I will add I am spoiled with Starbucks at home. I appreciated the service  from Madeline as she promptly got my usual coffee just about every morning as well as a pastry to hold my child over until we went to breakfast. The coffee shop at the Royalton has a better variety of drink options including alcoholic caffeinated beverages! It is only a short walk and very close to the gym as well! ", "Beach", "The beach is also just a short walk or you can take the transit which comes every five minutes or so. Personally, we enjoyed the walk and my daughter would feed the ducks and peacocks. The buffet that you have access to outside next to the beach as well as the bar is great! There is also a server walking near the chairs that would gladly get you a beverage. The beach had plenty of shaded beds and there was minimal seaweed!", "Pool", "We spent a lot of our time at the main (larger) pool near the Selections buffet. There were men cleaning it every morning and working very hard to scrub the tile. The pool was nice and large enough that I felt comfortable floating on my raft! The \"vibe team\" had entertainment, activities and games going on throughout the day, there was a snack cart with burgers, hot dogs and fries, bathrooms and the towel hut was right there as well! ", "Waterpark", "The waterpark is great as they have a variety of age appropriate slides, wave pool and a baby pool with slides. We did not spend that much time here this year because my daughter is 10 now and runs through the larger slides then is done! There weren't as many lounge chairs and no alcohol in this section, but that is how it should be! I was shocked to see a lost child there as well as an unresponsive child that had to receive CPR with BOTH parents NOWHERE to be found! The resort staff did a great job with both situations. The lost boy was no older than three years old and they kept in with lifeguards in the shade and got him a drink as they called security and then had a separate lifeguard go around and ask families! ", "Safety", "I chose to travel with my child to the Dominican Republic because I feel so comfortable as compared to Jamaica and Mexico. We actually did not use the safe because we kept getting an error code and didn't feel like bothering the front desk. Our phones, electronics and cash were never touched and were left unattended in our room for eight days! Also, we didn't even notice until this morning that our door was open the entire night last night..not like unlocked but like a few inches open because for some reason it did not close behind us like we were used to it doing on its own! Bottom line, I feel completely safe here. The noise as previously commented in other posts did not bother us! Yes, the peacocks squeaked but we were already up. There was noise from the dancing etc at night, but we could sleep right through it. I would suggest bringing ear plugs if either bother you! Honestly, the loudest was drunk adults at 2-3am running through the tile hallways. Owell, like I said we are solid sleepers so no harm!", "This is definitely a family oriented resort. If you do not want to be bothered with children I definitely suggest that you book at the sister resort the Royalton or the Royalton Hideaway. Tips for someone that has not been here before: bring plenty of sunscreen (especially since the gift shop sells it for $25+ a bottle if you run out, bring a cup like a yeti or bubba so your drinks stay cold and pool water free, bring a cheap raft and pool toys that you can easily pass to another family (this will also save you money). Bring maybe one of your own beach towels to mark your set of chairs as all of the resort towels are either blue or brown and you can easily lose your lounge chair. Lastly, bring $1 and 5$ bills to tip the workers that are providing such great service with such positive energy! I could not believe how many people do not tip! A dollar a round of drinks was GREATLY appreciated and we left 5$ each sit down dinner, which was also very much appreciated! I hope I answered any questions for families thinking of traveling here! We will be returning next year for a relaxing, kid friendly trip :)"]},

Check in was very quick and easy. Our room was a mini suite, nothing special, however the main concern I had was how the shower is positioned over the bath. Do you really need suach a big bathtub?  It is a health & safety risk getting in and out of the shower as the side of the bath was wet and if you slipped , there are no handles to grab onto. Maybe just have a walk in shower and get rid of the bath. We tried the various speciality restuarants and I have to say, we found them to be rather disappointing. The Portafino, needs to have better lighting, it was very dimly lit inside, poor selection on menu, The Argentinian, it was nothing special either. As soon as you are seated in these restuarants, the staff are straight down with the wine menu, when you just ask for a glass of house wine, they become somewhat less friendly, is this because they rely on people spending money ???

Sunbeds were widely available but there was a race if you wanted one of the few cabanas dotted around the pool.  Sometimes the Royal Service butlers were up earliest, reserving these for the Royal Service guests.

All the employees were polite, and best of all, they were fun, cheery and willing to joke around with you. It made for an extremely comfortable and casual family atmosphere.

They had a blast and did not want to leave.  And the food!  Crazy amounts of awesome fruits, vegetables, meats, fish and poultry in an incredible choice of dishes at the buffet area.  The chefs will cook omelets and steaks right in front of you to order, and you can keep going back for more! We were overwhelmed with the selections, side dishes and the desserts at the buffet. We also enjoyed the Italian restaurant nestled beside the Belini Bar (ate there twice!) and our waiter, Maykel, was awesome.  He made absolutely certain our birthday celebration for one of the boys in our group was memorable as the staff came out singing Happy Birthday and playing makeshift kitchen instruments table-side.

We also liked the Mexican restaurant too.  Great food and staff. ", "There were multiple pools to choose from depending upon your mood but we opted for the beach most of the time. My only criticism of the beach is the resort has placed four-sided rental shade huts along the beach directly in front of the thatched-roof shade huts which block the view of the ocean when the occupants close the curtains to escape the sun. We came to D.R. to experience the beach and ocean; not stare at a row of cloth curtains  6 feet in front of our faces. This was a common criticism among all 8 adults in our group and others we spoke to.  The rental cloth huts are also so close together that it made seeing the water difficult to those of us occupying the free thatched-roof shade huts right behind them. The management should re-think placement as it really spoils the view for the majority of beach-goers. The problem is compounded when big groups occupy the four-sided cloth huts because they block the narrow passages between the huts with beach chairs, making it problematic getting from the shade areas to the water without having to walk all the way around the 20 or so structures.  Please, move those rental huts to the side or space them apart farther! They are annoying! ", "Overall, however, we had a great time, the kids were safe, we had more than we could possibly eat and we would consider going back again!  It was a bit different than our usual choice of trips to St. John USVI as we usually like to hike in the national park.  We did not take part in any hiking excursions off the resort so we can't provide good feedback on those options.  If you like to run or work out you're limited on the resort to about a half to 3/4 of a mile of beach and a half mile of sidewalks that run across the resort. But hey, it's vacation!  There is a small fitness center at the Royalton for those who prefer lifting weights and working on machines, but we preferred to walk and run the beach in he early mornings. ", "All in all we had an extremely relaxing and comfortable vacation that made our teenage boys extremely happy as there was plenty going on to keep them busy and entertained. The resort offered music, beach parties and some theatre events for the young folks in the evening. Happy teens make for happy parents!  ", "A couple of us just wish the bars and restaurants offered at least one stout beer on the menu as an option to the local El Presidente beer.  There's a lot of us from the north who love stout, even in hot weather! Try Sierra Nevada stout! ", "Thanks again to all the staff at the resort for a memorable time!

The service was even more horrible. I did not think the food would be the same as 'home' but some of the food was inedible.  For example at breakfast, scrambled eggs weren't fully cooked.  Stale bread for toast.  Attempted to eat a burger from the grill at lunch but it most definitely was not a burger, same as with the chicken.

They came and gave us towels and restocked the fridge.  The 3rd day we went to the guest services at 8am and told them our room hadn't been cleaned.   We were told that there is a switch on the door that you have to move to green to have your room cleaned otherwise the room isn't cleaned.  We told them that we had no such switch but we wanted the room cleaned.  AT 5pm the room still  wasn't cleaned. We requested a manager (which wasn't available) and spoke to someone else who told us the same thing about the switch.

All the staff walk around like they are so miserable and it truly sucks to vacation in an environment where the vibes are all off. ", "The 24 hour sports bar was also a disaster. We wanted pizza and they stayed they didn\u2019t have any. A few hours later we went back and the other patrons stated to us that they just had pizza. Very disappointing to hear. When we asked a server she laughed and stated \u201csomething like that.\u201d ", "The second night we visited the sports bar, the tables were unoccupied and dirty. As we sat down we asked a server to help us clean it as the previous party who was there has spike led a drink and the server proceeded to say \u201cthat\u2019s not my job at this hour, I have to go.\u201d And left. It was almost 20 minutes before we were able to grab the attention of someone else who came to ask if we wanted to order anything and then wiped the table with an attitude. Needless to say, we left.

The property is so so beautiful and impeccably manicured....everyone works so hard. Beach was great,pools were great! We were in room 5908 toward the back and the room was beautiful- fully stocked fridge that was replenished without request if needed. The only complaint was that the shower was very slow to drain after we used it. Property is older but as I stated before it is just beautifully kept. The food, although is was generally great was not the best we have had at various resorts. Our waiter Delvi at the restaurant Bamboo was so fun hospitable. The food at the hibachi restaurant was the best. I would definitely stay here again."]},

Except for lack of hangars and hooks to hang items, everything was good. The only downfall to this resort and all the others along the same stretch of beach is the sea weed that is a big issue all along the beach. So bad that most of the hotels have booms surround the swimming area trying to contain the amount of sea debris washing up every day. Some of the resorts have, payloads, tractors with bailers attached and dump trucks taking away debris every second day. That is the one MAIN reason I would NOT recommend this resort as a go to destination which is too bad as the resort itself was good, food delicious and plenty of lots of variety etc..."]},

The resort included the fishing village and several other restaurants, so ultimately our UK tour company TUI or Thomsons blatantly misled us British tourists, but we no longer travel with them due to their complete lack of giving a toss for anyone. However, initially having lost half a resort we found the pools , man made beach and gardens lovely. Dont expect lush palms and shade as its fairly new. We arrived and denied them the unnecessary 300 dollar deposit, this is for percieved spending, then found our room filthy, glasses mugs chairs etc missing. My wife had a meeting with the main house keeper and resolved the issues. New furniture new curtains, a clean and replacement of missing items. Our butler was Harry, sadly an incompetant fool. He gave us a tour, never told us the spa was included nor did he say that all inclusive included spirits in the room, as we found 3 months before at TRS Bavaro. He asked what was more important  for us bearing in mind the list of issues my wife had previously  furnished the staff with. He also wandered through rooms at random to speak to guests,  not even their rooms , so we kept our swim up locked...not at all respectful. ", "They embrace wattsap as the main tool for everything  but we go away to escape phones so we used the room phone to contact reception.also butlers should not plonk themselves down next to you half way through a meal and chat.... ..they appear to serve no purpose except interfere....our previous experience  with trs butlers at bavaro was fantastic, non intrusive and always helpful, curteous and respectful. However issues sorted the room service gent sorted our ice, wine and drink requests as we were a distance from the bar we got sporadic bar service, even though it was 40 per cent full. ", "The food was great quality, although waiting for an hour for breakfast that never arrived, and also for an evening meal in the japanese is not acceptable  when they simply forget you are there. Helios on the beach is also hit and miss, i ordered baked patato and chicken to get mash and pork, as nice as it was if i were jewish i would have had reason to be offended, not with standing  that no pork was even on the menu, when i told the food beverige manager he promised to have a word then promptly walked off in the opposite  direction. I caught him the following night and he shrugged saying, \" its ok though\" ...not really. Location is great, but not idillic, clean public areas andwhen pressed rooms too.", "The lack of children is great but management and butlers need to stick to defined roles and not invade private spaces. Reception staff ignore comments, butlers wander aimlessly around and very little swim up service. Bizarrely  we had a great stay, and would visit this resort again but if it purports to be be 5 star it needs to up its game in cleanliness, public service and dicipline to staff...god help them if anything goes missing when a butler walks through a room to speak to someone 3 rooms away because the lock is not on... also to even allocate a room in the hotel before it is checked is just poor shoddy and not 5 star...this was very disappointing...", "In short you have to wait for gkasses to be filked, wait for food that may or may not be what you ordered , if it came at all, and had to deal sith the daily intrusion. A fina example is a beer bottle was dropped on the pool side which broke...the butler was nearby, Harry, and was told,  and as it was a communal area advised it needed immediate  attention . I dived and recovered every little shard,  and the pool staff arrived 26 hours later to clear it up!.", "The room cleaners, fridge stocker and gardeners , workedcreally hard and covered for the lack of direction from the butlers...so we got the service we expected eventually but the reception, butlers and service was very hut and miss.

{"hotel": ["Secrets Royal Beach Punta Cana"], "title": ["very nice"], "content": ["We recently returned from Punta Cana and stayed at Secrets Royal Beach.  Upon arrival, the front area people were very nice and welcoming.  We loved the all inclusive and found the food to be good, not amazing but very good.  I will say the males at the resort were very nice and very helpful but the females not as much, especially in the casino....if you can call it that.  Please do not book this hotel if you want to gamble.  It's very small and the staff are not friendly at all.  No air conditioning in the casino either but with that said, we still had fun gambling.  We did take a trip to the Hard Rock which is a real casino however it cost $70 round trip for a 20 minute ride.  The cab drivers are all very nice.  One of the nicest staff members we met was Miguel A.Oceana.  He was so kind and helpful with making reservations for us and we can just see what a hard worker he was.  Thank you Miguel!  Overall our stay at Secrets was very nice, property very clean but I would try a different place next time.  Some how they convinced us to meet for the 90 min vacation package seminar which turned into a disaster and took up half our day.  I would avoid it at all costs!    Punta cana is very nice however the surrounding town is not.  there is not a nice town to walk through and for the most part, you need to remain at the resort.  Heading to Mexico next!!"]},

I\u2019m 30 and my mother is 60 and requires mostly use of a wheelchair, we have no children and mostly wanted an adult vacation. We also tip everyone and tip well! I will start with the positive : ", "1.) The beach is gorgeous and grounds are beautiful, well maintained. ", "2.) the \u201csecret pool\u201d or adult pool was also fantastic, relaxing and even had a really fun foam party for the adults. Luis was the server at the adult pool and was EXCELLENT! He was quick to bring drinks and smiles to all the guests. ", "3.) breakfast and lunch had a lot of options at the buffets (with great service by Mildred), El dorado and \u201cfirst wine\u201d is the steakhouse and had very good food. Beautiful pastries and good service by Manuela (pastry chef). Ramon was very accommodating and pleasant in El dorado as well.", "4.) Our ocean view room was clean, convenient and close to everything.", "5.)The spa is beautiful and massage was excellent. All the staff in the Spa were extra friendly!", "6.) since most service at the lobby was poor, I\u2019d like to say a special thank you to Alberto for going out of his way to verify my transport", "As for the negative, I have to say I am cautious about returning and would most likely choose an adults only and another all inclusive that catered more to its guests..", "1.) I am one person and was pushing my disabled mother throughout the resort and found it very difficult for help with luggage and even some downright inconsiderate tram drivers (not all) that wouldn\u2019t stop for us to offer us transport through the resort and even dropped us in the middle of an inaccessible area not helping with lifting the heavy chair. I can say that this really is not a very handicapped friendly resort and the staff, other than Luis & a handful of others, were not very helpful. My mother actually fell from her chair on the grounds due to a lot of uneven pavement and bricks and hurt her arm and face. Something I would recommend considering to those who would be traveling with someone in a wheelchair. ", "2.) Reservations are not required at any restaurant except the Japanese restaurant which means arriving at guests services (since you cannot usually get through to the front desk) at the crack of dawn 24 hours in advance to reserve in line. On top of this, there are very long waits to get into other restaurants. I found this very inconvenient and never had an issue like this at any other resort. I requested several times for wine to be delivered to the room and this became an impossible request, transferred from person to person and denied. ", "3.) I know and understand basic Spanish and would have to say communication with only basic Spanish is very difficult. This was noticed by all the guests I spoke with and very frustrating.", "4.) I understand you do not come to Punta Cana for Italian but the food at Portofino I would not recommend and wouldn\u2019t return for it.", "5.) Disorganization and poor service have to be my biggest concern. I couldn\u2019t get through to the front desk by phone for questions or service and if I did I was transferred from person to person or answered rudely.", "Overall we had a great trip and would personally like to thank Luis, Mildred, Manuela, Ramon, July, Alberto for their excellent service. However, this is possibly a resort that would be more for families more than adults (especially those who are handicapped) and people who aren\u2019t expecting their needs catered to as much as other resorts I\u2019ve been to down to even the basics like help with luggage etc. "]},

Part 1"], "content": ["As we are laying on their bed that's feels like a bed of \"ROCKS\", with a pillow that's suppose to be feather down but again feels like rocks down! This place from the minute of walking in yesterday has ruined our much needed vacation from battling health problems these past 2 years!!!!!", "  We arrived yesterday per their site and other reviews list this place as \"PUNTA CANA\" Well it's not located there it's located in Baravo 17 minutes away. Which is sad because we picked this place, called spoke to a rep and they said it's in \"PUNTA CANA\" lies they tell. As we get dropped off upon arrival they are suppose to give you a towel and a drink?? But instead what they gave us was their back. That service was given to the other races not us. The waitress literally looked at us gave us her back and the people walking in behind us not Spanish or black(that looks Dominican) like we do, she gave them their drink and bellhop gave them there wash cloth. Now we have stayed at plenty of all inclusive and 5 stars plus penthouses. This is not a 4.5 it's closer to a 2.5 and thats being nice. So now we are at the checking observing and still with no welcome drink they come pass us look at us again give us their back. After 30 plus minutes we say to the receptionist/clerk like what's going here why are we being treated differently. We notice that other races(not trying to make it a race thing but its obvious) are getting welcome treatment and we other Spanish people are being treated poorly? He apologizes called the waitress and bellhop over and they gave us our drink and towel. At this point we didn't want it and we were over it. It was suppose to be a light refreshing, fruity drink. At this point we have a bad taste in our mouth about this place. We get taken to our room bellhop was very nice and helpful(sorry don't remember his name) as upon entering the room the bellhop smelled cigars, I smelled a wet damped smell and we have our 11 month old baby with us not good plus i have asthma. We looked over the room with bellhop and found that the toilet seat was broken and the air was blowing warm air. He calls over for them to fix the problems. He asked us to wait for them, we told him they can fix it we don't need to be here.                                         We arrived at 5:30pm and wanted to go eat. He said, \"OK\", so we changed the baby and left. We walked to the steakhouse put our name on the list about 6:17pm they just opened at 6pm and there was 7 people before us. So we were waiting..... AND 45 minutes later boom no POWER everything was pitch black dark and not even a single person from the resort came over to communicate or reassure us. Everyone was sitting by the pool and in the restaurant lobby in the dark. An hour has passed and still nobody from the resort SOMEBODY from the RESORT should have came to communicate an hour has passed and finally the lights come back on like really we just got here!!! What 4.5 is this. So now I go check to see where we are on the list we only had 2 people in front us. I was talking to the hostess in Spanish mistake number 4. I said ok sat back down. We were watching people from other races going in Coming out. Now we are like 2 hours in with just 2 people in front of us. I go back up again spoke to her in Spanish and she said to me you have 3 people in front of you?? I said you told me 30 minutes it was 2 she said someone returned and got put back in the list if they left they should have not been put back on to their original spot. So I come out and send my husband in he was holding the baby while I was in and out and different hostess tells him I have a table for you. As I walk in the other host tells the other one walking us in I told her no tables were ready. Now the place is nice inside and big people were getting their food quick so what was the hold up. Our server Jose comes over we ordered our food I even added the lobster for 35 dollars extra. He came out with an app platter, seafood soup that was good. Now we checked the time 9:25pm because we wanted to catch the show at 10pm. We were like ok where are our entrees. We see other tables getting theirs that say after us. We did ask for well done so we know it take a little longer time to cook but it's been a while and now we going on over 3 hours closer to 4 waiting on food!!! We asked Jose about our food he said because it's taken them time to cook the lobster. I said being out the steaks first then the lobster later he said ok. Brings our steaks we cut into them nothing but blood and red everywhere. Now if we were waiting for over 45 minutes for our food the steak should have been burnt. We send them back 5 minute later they bring them out again I cut a different side of mines noting but blood again and red not even pink. They tame it back said they were going to bring another one same thing worst just because it looks cook on the outside you are suppose to touch with a fork for tenderness to make sure it's cook. Now I'm like I don't want it just bring the lobster. Jokes on me Haha the manager comes over to ask what can I do I said all I wanted was a well down steak just please I'll take the lobster to go. He was away 10 minutes later nothing so we still put a tip on the table and get up to leave just over it. The manager holds the door for us and I asked where is my lobster he said \"I canceled it, it was going to take longer to cook in spanish\". AND LAUGHED IN OUR FACE!! Who is he to cancel and order that I place over an 1 hour and 39 minutes ago??? ", "Upset and now it's late with the baby and hungry that I am we walked over to the lobby spoke to Paulino, that claimed he was going to take a report. What is a report??????? If I'm here right now being treated this way. Which we paid our hard earn money for all inclusive and we couldn't even eat the first night. Stay tune for day 2.

We booked an ocean view room and were pleased with the view. The resort is spotless and our room was cleaned, and bed clothes changed, daily. Our cleaner, Maria, was lovely. She spoke limited English but we were able to communicate and she was always helpful and cheerful. The food was nice, with a good choice  my only complaint would be it was always luke warm, rather than hot.  Staff were really friendly, it is the Caribbean so they are very laid back and service is a little slow at times, but everyone was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint, and this is just a personal opinion, is that the staff at night and on the beach during the day, come over and try to get guests up dancing or doing beach aerobics. I personally hate this, as if I wanted to join in I would. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable at times, but other guests seemed to really enjoy it. My advice would be to take US dollars as everything is priced in dollars, not Dominican pesos. We were all inclusive and the staff asked if we wanted to upgrade to premium inclusive as this would give priority in restaurants, an exclusive area on the beach and a quieter pool. We opted not to upgrade and were glad we hadn't. We had no issues getting into any of the restaurants, as we went for an evening meal when the restaurants opened at 6.30pm. There were always plenty of sun loungers on the beach in the non exclusive part ( which were right next to the exclusive ones) and we don't sit by the pool. I believe the upgrade cost is about \u00a3180 for 2 people for 10 days. The beach is beautiful, but there was always a sewer smell from the sea and the water isnt clear. However, there are security guards on the beach day and night and workers constantly clearing up the seaweed which is brought in by the tide.

In. Con. Sistent. We legit ordered the exact same meals two mornings in a row and the first day was wonderful, and the next day took over 40 mins to receive and came out BURNT. Noticeably burnt, to the point where they never should have served it to us. They have menu items, such as bagels, that they never had, the whole week. The servers were slow, not super friendly ( except the young man with braces, he rocked. We didn't always get his section). ", "We had to switch rooms after about 2-3 hours of being at the resort. The lights would go off about every 10 minutes and had to be reset. Shower... light off. Potty... lights off.  Reading... lights off. We complained, twice, and they had a guy come out and look at it and said everything was fine. After the 3rd time of complaining, we finally were able to get moved to a different room. The original room also smelled like mildew and the comforter felt wet, not even damp, wet. The light on the patio of the swim up room also did not work along with half the outlets. HOWEVER, after being switched to another swim up room, we realized just how awful the original room was, the new room was delightful. No smell, everything worked, we were in an end room and had easy access to the pool area. The only con of the new room is that there is virtually no lights unless you are in the bathroom. There are no real lights at all in the living area over the 4 person table or the full length mirror. ", "The wine selection is a joke and the mini bar in the room is even more of a joke.

To top it off, they didn't even have all the wines from the purchase list available. So, I gave up on drinking wine and started drinking vodka/cranberry and some bars didn't have cranberry, what? really? The other two bars have cranberry, go and get it from them. The minibar only offers one beer, although the resort only offer a single light beer in total. It didn't get filled often, and was not very cold.

He provided us with a way to message him as needed, and was very responsive. On the second day he lost his phone and no more contact was really had other than when we would pass each other randomly walking around. I would have expected him to check in on us periodically, but that really didn't happen.

The handful of staff we mentioned were outstanding and truly made the trip enjoyable, the resort is over all very clean and very safe. All of Fishing Lodge is very safe. We were able to walk down the pier/marina outside the resort with no worries at all. Overall, this is a newer resort that has potential but just has to work through these issues. We would consider coming back here after some time. If you aren't a sit-on-the-beach person, this is still a good resort. There is virtually no beach or ocean swimming options.

This was our third visit to this resort and we are never disappointed! This is the first time we stayed in the Royal Service section and it was very nice, but I am not sure it is necessary for us. I did enjoy the La Palapa restaurant which is exclusive to Royal Service and having a butler was nice to make our reservations and fulfill our requests for what we needed in our room but we didn\u2019t have much for him to do. That being said we appreciated how pleasant Alex (our Butler) was and he was very helpful and followed through with all that we requested.  Also the bartenders at the Royal Service  pool (Juan Cruz and Jose Luis Montilla )were outstanding and always friendly and made the best drinks- they really work hard !  I have to say the pool in Royal Service was very small and the water is really murky which is a problem.  The main pool is huge so it never felt crowded -so much better, but the beach is the highlight here- it is fantastic.  There really are a lot of wonderful restaurants and bars at this resort - the last time we were there we were a little disappointed in the food but loved the beach and the beautiful surroundings (that\u2019s why we returned) but we were pleasantly surprised that the food was so much better this time .  We want to point out the great job Leandro, Julio, Jose Luis, Juana ,Jesica and Ariel Vargas did at both the main lobby bar and the Gabi Beach bar, so fun and friendly and made wonderful cocktails! I loved the variety of entertainment in the main lobby and at Gabi beach - music and shows and a fun beach party . We are in our mid fifties and like nightlife but not too late and this resort was just right for us.  We will definitely return !"]},

Felt as if we were being delayed from starting our vacation until we were checked in after 3pm and our bags finally arrived closer to 4pm. On a side note during the holding period we were graciously greeted by Ken Rodriguez (Circle Rep - Paradisus Sister Hotel) who ended up becoming an important part of our trip. Ken met with us and explained all of our benefits and options (Royal Service) as well as providing an on foot tour of the surrounding area. Once settled we finally felt that our vacation had started but were disappointed to find out the Ken was not our butler as he had us smiling from the minute we met. We throughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel and the Royal Service was worth the extra. If we travel here again we won\u2019t have so many expectations for the butler service as we didn\u2019t see our butler, Carlos, very much. He checked on us occasionally and did make a nice gesture one day by leaving champagne and a cheese and fruit platter. But we would have like for him to be more pro active than reactive. The restaurants were delicious and the service was great. But the daily visit or checkin from Ken helped us in more ways than we expected. He answered all of our questions when we would stop by the Royal Service Lounge and even stopped by the beach to see how our stay was each day. He also shared stories and information about the Dominican lifestyle which we appreciate when traveling to other countries. Overall I would recommend this resort and hope others are fortunate enough to meet Ken. Thank you Paradisus! "]},

They surround the pool so you cannot even relax without the hassle. The beach is even worse! It is an open/public beach so local vendors walk the sand all day with the same sales tactics. They were waking people up on their lounge chairs! It was near impossible to relax. The food at the resort was satisfactory. The restaurants are better than the buffet's, but they're not great.

(We actually ended up walking down the beach most nights to the restaurants - not even a quarter mile) We did tip at the resort, and we thought the service was excellent.  Entertainment at the Punta Cana pool was lively. Notes\u2014we took our yeti cups and the bartenders were happy to put our drinks in those, they stay cold MUCH longer! We also booked through Expedia, requested deluxe rooms in this section, and included our flights. We would love to return\u2014fabulous trip for the adults and the teens!"]},

However, it\u2019s not set to cater the individuals seeking product quality or service. People walk around with big mugs knowing they have to fetch their drinks. And being in VIP means that you still have to get up and get your drink and unless you ask and complain, your named brand liquor will likely always be unavailable. It is unfortunate that the people that come here settle for so little. I made the best of my time and did enjoy the amenities. The food in my opinion was limited and repetitive but well seasoned and tasty. I enjoyed the Brazilian restaurant, the Fondue and the best Cappuccino next to the Brazilian restaurant. Our room was 4116. In a great location, nice and cold and clean. Our attendant missed our sleepers, our robes where in rags and for some reason we didn\u2019t get any face washcloths...we also only got two bath towels. I left a list of minor repairs needed before I left. So, the location is good, the food is limited but good, the room is good, entertainment is good too. My only problem is not getting service at the beach or pool. Not knowing about specialty drinks. If they improve that they will see a wave of more visitors.

The only bar with descent drinks was the main lobby bar. Room service just walks in on you so beware.

At first I didn\u2019t want to believe it and I myself told them maybe it\u2019s just mosquitos or something. Well after returning lastnight from our trip I went to go shower and realized the bites in pattern just like bed bugs on both my legs and my girlfriends.

We never recieved the rose petal bath so on the second to last day i asked about it and he asked if we had told anyone about us being on honeymoon before our arrival. I know we did because they mentioned it at check in", " He said that he would make a call and get the rose petals for that night. We stayed out of the room for a long time after that and upon returning nothing in the room. The room attendant didnt touch our room often. When the lady called to ask how our staywas i brought it up and she said it must have been because we left the do not disturd light on.

Tripadvisor limits the review length, so i can't go into details about our concerns, but they were minor. I still would have liked it resolved. The resort is very well taken care of and the grounds are well manicured. If you plan on spending anytime on the beach, be prepared to be hounded constantly from the natives trying to sell anything from pictures with there pets to selling you weed.

The sales people at the beach harassing you every 30 seconds 2.No offense but the weddings at the beach every day setup and on the preferred beach section not cool and annoying. 3. Nobody at the resort has any wrist bands to identify who's part of which section preferred or non-preferred section so anybody can wander off in any section they choose. 4. A lot of the chairs on the non-preferred side of the beach are damaged (holes in material and parts missing).5. If you like the beach don't book at the Garden section (Formally the Now Garden) you'll end up upgrading like we did so we can be closer to the beach. So if I would give a rating from 1- 5 I would rate Now as a 3 ! I would like to give credit to an awesome waiter at the buffet named Fraudy! He was very attentive in tune for our needs he should definitely get a raise thank you Fraudy ! Also I would like to give credit to Samuel who helped us upgrade to an awesome room and for your service thank you! Hope this helps for anybody planning to book a trip at this overrated resort."]},

I can not say enough great things about him. He really took care of us & catered to our needs! He made sure our fridge was stocked at all times! He\u2019s so nice & friendly!!  We would return just to have Harry as our butler. Shout all to all the great staff- they are all super nice- the guy in the bar upstairs who makes the smoked drinks, Johanna, Roberto in caprico, 2 different waiters named Juan & John from the activities/entertainment crew & many others whose names I can\u2019t remember. The resort itself is beautiful and very clean. We had the swim up room in block 2 which was amazing!! love, love, loved it! the only problem with our room was the fridge keeping the beer cold! It was mostly warm but Harry would bring us beers in a bucket of ice so that was great! There is no beach so it is non existent as others have mention but if you are not a big beach person then this is no problem. I read the reviews before our stay so no beach no problemo to us .The resort will shuttle you to a near by beach but at that beach you'll have to pay for food and alcohol so we didn't go, why pay for all inclusive and buy drinks or food. The smell of the fish f/ the marina is bad at first, but  you'll get use to it. There is only one type of beer the resort severs, it's presidente which was a pretty good beer. The food is very mediocre, average at best and i hope they improve with this. Language barrier was a slight problem but nothing huge for example, we would point at an item in the menu to order but would receive something entirely different. the alcohol isn't top shelf either but they keep it flowing. i did see a bottle of gray goose vodka but only in 2 bars and not sure they severed it- lbvs. All in all great vacation, happy i chose this place, staff was great, resort was beautiful, awesome time and i got engaged :)"]},

Since these are out of the control of the resort I did not count it against them."]},
{"hotel": ["Impressive Resort & Spa Punta Cana"], "title": ["If you\u2019re considering this place, just keep looking..."], "content": ["Let me start by saying that I am a 3rd generation Dominican that speaks the language fluently and visits the country quite often. With that said, Punta Cana is never really my go to location as it is very touristy and doesn\u2019t really allow for the true experience of what DR has to offer. A friend and I had a few days off of work and were just looking for an inexpensive getaway to relax and catch some rays. We came across Impressive, it was moderately priced and seemed to suit our needs. Moderately priced was the only thing they checked off on our mental check list of what a great resort is. Check in was an absolute nightmare. It took 3 hrs and 2 rooms later (the first of which was assigned to us while it was still occupied!) when they finally did get us a room, my friend and I were forced to share a bed because they apparently didn\u2019t have any double beds available. Thankfully she\u2019s not a bad sleeper and that wasn\u2019t too much of an inconvenience. The food was AWFUL. The buffet was just bland, soda was flat, flies were a dime a dozen. To their credit, they did eventually upgrade us to their \u201cpremium\u201d services which doesn\u2019t offer you much but access to a private section of the beach and what they call \u201cpremium\u201d alcohol of which the only notable brand was Johnny Walker. Of the entire trip there were 2 people that made it as comfortable as they could given the circumstances. The bartender in the main lobby Julio Cesar is the sweetest man you\u2019ll ever meet! Definitely a shining star of the hotel if you as me & these bellboys named Alfredo & Enger went above and beyond the call of duty to do what they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Had it not been for them, I\u2019m not sure what we could have done. DR is a beautiful country with a lot to offer, this isn\u2019t an adequate depiction of that. To the management, you have some great people working for you, but your amenities, policies and procedures... need some serious work."]},
{"hotel": ["Impressive Resort & Spa Punta Cana"], "title": ["Real Impressive Experience in Punta Cana. Top Choice Resort"], "content": ["REVIEW IMPRESSIVE RESORTS & SPAS", "This was my nineth time in the Dominican Republic (DR) so I have been in practically all the major 5 stars resorts (Bavaro Princess, Bahia Pr\u00edncipe, Iberostar, Catalonia, Barcelo, etc, etc) in Punta Cana. Let me tell you that I was really well impressed with Impressive Resort & Spa. The new management has made a great job transforming what was the Sunscape Hotel into a top choice. The main lobby is beautiful and a very pleasant place to be near the dance floor and the Theater where the nights begin. Overall the hotel has the perfect size. Not to big, you can walk everywhere in less than 5 minutes but you can also get a ride in one those golf cars always passing by with driven by the nicest staff. Beautiful gardens, 4 pools, very clean beach with white sand with no seawit and the only Pier that I know in Bavaro Beach where we can take a walk and enjoy the view from the sea or even have dinner. Clean transparent warm sea water. Good variety of all kinds of food including local Dominican specialities. Great staff and guest atmosphere with a wide variety of nationalities mostly European (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian) but also a great presence of always cheerful and happy Dominicans giving a local touch to the whole experience. One of the biggest gyms I have seen in a DR resort, and a great big Play Room with snooker tables, ping pong, table soccer, video games (Xbox, wii, Playstation, etc). The main buffet was great so we didn't go to any of the other restaurants but one good thing is that there is no need to make reservations on the thematic restaurants. Overall Impressive Resort was a very pleasant surprise. If you don't like huge resorts where you have to take a mini car everywhere and you like beauty and the tropical happy Dominican experience, then I think that Impressive Resort is for you. One last thing it is better to buy the all week wifi for 2 devices for 30 dolars the internet is great even on the Beach. Otherwise in the free wifi common areas we find it sometimes to slow due to many people using it at the same time. Hope you find this review useful and can benefit from it. Have a great holidays!\u00a0"]},

The food - absolutely amazing.  Lots of variety on the buffet, the a la carte restaurants were okay with a standout dish each visit but my preference was the buffet simply due to the broad selection and opportunity to try new foods, like mashed plantains.  The wine is sadly not drinkable.  We did not buy a bottle but they did have them available for purchase.  The beachfront restaurant/bar Mare Norstrum is amazing with a constant mini-buffet available especially the welcomed fried chicken, empanadas, and cookies every afternoon at 3pm!  The beds were fairly firm but viewed as comfortably by all.  The beach palapas and pool palapas are generous enough to shade 4, and always easy to find.  Everyone reserved places at the beach and the pool, in fact I think some left towels 24/7.  The pool bar is a great place to hang out mid-late afternoon, lots of area in the shade and we met a ton of really great people.  It is truly a place you can relax....everywhere you look relaxing adults mostly 40s, 50s, 60s with maybe 25% in their 20s and 30s (while I was there).  LOTS of returning, many have been going to that resort for 10 years or more.  The beach sand is easy to walk in for deep beach sand and if you like to walk along the beach you can for a good long ways past the other resorts.  No beach vendors except enough for there to be beach vendors.  Resorts are far removed from the main road and the entire beach is full of resorts.  CONS - The water is a little choppy for my preference.  Great if you want to sail a sunfish or kite surf but not the greatest for enjoying/swimming. (certainly not the hotel's fault, lol!) La Petit Fondue was named by a group at the pool bar one day as La Petit FonDONT. None of us enjoyed it nor several others we spoke with.  Balcony chairs could be upgraded. Pretty hard to find much bad to say.  Bathroom stalls are entirely too small.  The upside is the lobby and buffet bathrooms are an air-conditioned palace.  As a whole it's not a 5 star experience but it's a solid 4 for sure. Lots of foreigners which I found enjoyable as while you can hear conversations you can't understand them all, lol!  Lots of Canadians and British as well, but we heard French, Italian, and German while there.", "TIPS - VIP Arrival at Punta Cana airport was the BEST!  For $60-$75 per person someone greets you at the plane and personally escorts you to your transportation, going to the front of the line at both Immigration and Customs.  We were in our transport 20 minutes after landing.  The looks of the others on our plane when we walked right by them with our escort was worth half the $75 alone.  No need to over pack - a backpack and a small carry-on is all you need.  Ladies - 2-3 swimsuits, 2-3 coverups, 4-5 dresses(if that many). Backpack - I found mine invaluable. TAPESTRY - at the last minute I threw my twin size Amazon purchased $8 cheap Bohemian tapestry and it was GREAT for covering my chair.  The chairs don't have cushions and their towels are maybe 3 star so having this soft sheet to lay on was great.  Clips for towels are needed as the beach is very windy.  And I took a bone-shaped beach pillow that was awesome on the beach and the plane.  And a sarong-type cover up that was nice to lounge with on the beach and was even used as a light blanket when it got cool on the beach early one morning.  Comfortable walking shoes as the property is nearly 1/4 mile deep.  Yeti or similar large cup is welcomed by the bartenders and keeps your drink cold for hours.  Punta Cana Princess checks a LOT of boxes and is a fantastic bang for the buck, for sure.  Very easy to see why so many return year after year.  Consistent quality and some of the best service we've ever received on one of the most beautiful Caribbean beaches = absolutely one of the best!  If you're going next week I'm WAY jealous!!!!!!"]},

Alejandra gave us and excellent and lovely services as well the short girl with blonde hair( she dressed in white and always singing). @ the lobby Bar.. first I have to mentioned our best bartender Jose Luis and the Girls..Glennys, Kenia, Luisa and few others ( I don't remember names) beside the great and excellent services we received they were kind, friendly and lovelys persons. We received hugs and kisses everytime we got together, we have so much fun with them that we prefered to stayed in the hotel rather to go out and we can't wait to go back.

Once again we booked our all inclusive through First Choice and the resort didn't disappoint. The weather was low 30s, which was hot but not unbearable (since we were travelling with a toddler). In my opinion it was the perfect time to go.", "HOTEL - The hotel is laid out in a strip of land which makes getting around very easy. You have a straight line from the reception to Bavaro Beach and nothing is more than a 10 minute walk. The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly. In fact the staff work extremely hard; regardless the time or weather there were always people out landscaping, cleaning and generally maintaining the resort. There is a little patch of jungle/wildlife in the centre so make sure you Deet yourself of an evening if you are crossing the bridge, but apart from that the resort is surprisingly mosquito free. The rooms were large, with the majority having garden views. The jacuzzi bath is a great idea, but if you are sharing a room, can be a little awkward due to the open plan nature of the room.", "POOL & BEACH - The pools are immaculate and very refreshing. There are several to choose from: the lazy river, the children's pool (with slides etc for ages 5+), the main Royalton pool (where they host aqua-aerobics, the foam party etc), the Infinity pool (with a swim up bar) & a shallow baby pool (with a partial canvas roof for shade). There is also a Diamond Club only pool but I cannot comment on any Diamond perks. The waiting staff by the pool where very helpful. I recommend tipping early for consistent and considerate service. I want to thank Alexander for his friendly and dedicated service. The beach is spotless, apart from a little seaweed, and there is ample sunbeds so you never have to worry about overcrowding.", "DINING - There are 8 restaurants and we were lucky enough to eat in 7 of them. There are the two main buffets, Gormet March\u00e9 & Oceanside which always served up a delicious variety of dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In fact we had a better steak here than in the steakhouse restaurant. Then there is Hunter, the steakhouse, which was a little disappointing and when eating with a baby, the dark, ambient lighting was a little hard to read in. The Sports Bar was a pleasant surprise - I recommend the Philly cheese steak baguette and Canadian fries. The Zen restaurant (which you have to book) does amazing Japanese cuisine - but don't eat lunch before as there is a lot of food. The Grazie Italian restaurant was delicious and we ate there a few times. Make sure you go early as it fills up fast. We also had lunch at the Rio Brazilian restaurant which has a gorgeous view of the ocean and delicious food. There are also several snack stops for pizza and burgers if you do not want to leave the poolside. We didn't try the Culinary Experience as is cost extra $$.", "All in all we had a fantastic 10 days away in paradise. A special thanks to Rubi and all the staff in the Cafe Lounge for keeping my husband stocked up on cappuccino. ", "WARNING: The only negative we have are the pushy reps that want to try and pitch you to become a Smart Travel member. Be very firm from the beginning, do not let them lure you in with a free welcome gift. It got pitched to us as a Diamond package sampling to encourage us to upgrade if we every return to a Royalton hotel, which is fine. It then turned into a 2hr sales meeting where a bully of a manager tries to convince you to buy through them, pay up front and save money if you agree to sign something then & there. If the staff told it as it was they would have fewer annoyed guests - or better yet, create a points reward system that allows discounts for repeat customers. I'd agree to that."]},

We originally booked because we thought it would be closer to the beach, they are all far away (.4 miles) from the beach. The rooms look like they've been recently updated but they had some weird quirks and issues with them. The bathroom is the nicest part of the room BUT very weird design. There is no door to the bathroom... so basically your bed is inside the bathroom. You WILL hear bathroom noises from your spouse, significant other, or friend so be aware of that. Also, if you are not there with a spouse and are there with a friend, be aware of this no bathroom door, so the clear shower door will give you a show. The doors to the toilet and the shower made a super loud crack everytime you opened them - not just our room, all three of our couples we traveled with had this same issue in the building we were in. The toilets continue running if you don't flush them just right. Also, our shower leaked a lot when we used the shower. Otherwise, great water pressure and the jacuzzi was very nice. We personally had no problems with hot water but another couple did. The rooms do have a strange musty smell to them. Furniture was hard, especially the bed, but it was fine. Also, just a closet, no drawers which I thought was strange. Also, make sure to use bottled water for brushing your teeth, you cannot use the water in the room.

They had run out of two different options on the menu. They never came back to refill our drinks. The food took forever to show up.  Once it did, one person didn't even get what they had asked for and they just gave her a random meal because they must have run out again.

There was barely anything fun to do at night, the disco is at the casino outside of the resort and we didn't feel comfortable going to that.

Hopefully I will be able to clarify few things that were confusing me. I\u2019ll start with the rooms. Our room was very new and spacious with nice balcony large flat screen TV, huge shower, lot of storage space for clothes (even suitcases) ceiling fan and great AC. Some reviews that I read complained of old \u201cmusty\u2019 rooms, our room  was anything but.....we were told that they just completed 10 moth renovation of the entire resort so it seems like old rooms are gone. The only thing that I didn\u2019t love about the room is that bed mattress was too hard. It might be a matter of preference but definitely not the type of comfort/quality that you get even in mid-priced hotels in US. Other than that rooms were great (we stayed in building 29).", "Some reviewers were complaining about sub-par experience because they were not members of the Diamond Club. Because of that I opted to pay for the Diamond Club upgrade (it was least then additional 10% of what I would have paid for \u201cregular\u201d package) and it was totally worth it, you get better service and access to better/additional amenities.

We have 2 kids aged 11 and 6. Our 6 year old is exactly 4 feet tall but on the first day they turned him down at the \u201cbig kid\u201d park and send him to the other part which was occupied mostly by toddlers and was totally underwhelming for him. That crated the issue because he wanted to go on the rides with his older brother. We then had to skip the park for next 2 days. On a day 3 we went back again, they measured him again and this time allowed him to go on bigger slides. Kids really had a blast and splash park definitely made big positive difference for us. I would suggest to people running the place to come up with some rides that would be more fun for kids under 4 feet but older than 4 years of age.", "Kids club, decent size with small outdoor space with trampoline, little slide and some climbing equipment. Our kids insisted on going mostly so that they could play video games (something that we restrict at home).

Probably one of the nicest beaches that we have seen during our travels. Fine sand. Not too much see weeds/grass, easy to enter (no hidden rocks) and very long (couple of miles). We had our lunch at the Diamond beach bar (one of the perks that comes with Diamond club upgrades). Food was not spectacular but the being able to have lunch outside was great. Also guys working at the beach bar were outstanding. I would especially like to mention Eliseo (who provided outstanding services) and Lenny and Jayson.", "Some reviews complained about how long it takes to get to beach or the timing of the trains. This resort (as far as these type of resorts go) is on a smaller size.

Here is my review on this resort.", "Food: We reserved our reservations one week prior to arriving. I suggest doing that or getting them as soon as you arrive. We ate the breakfast buffet at Gabi Beach and it was good for the most part. I lived off of cereal and fruit. My husband ate the eggs, bacon etc. and said it was decent. We also ate at Gabi Lunch for the lunch buffet and we all ate the salad bar, pizza, fries. It was decent as well. Now for the dinners we ate at Fuego (was our least favorite, hubby got fish and didnt like it and I got steak and it was just ok), Bana (Very entertaining and tasty), Mole (everything was good), The Grill (everything was good) and Aqua (this was VERY good, I got the lasagna and it was very tasty). ", "Beach: the beach at this resort is big and very spacious. My husband would put our towels out every morning around 9:30 and we had no issues getting a sunbed or chairs. They have the best stretch of beach in this area. And they seem to have less seaweed. There wasn't much seaweed until the last day. My kids kept coming out of the water because it was getting wrapped around their legs. But that's nature! The water is beautiful!", "Rooms: They would have had a 5 star but the room kept me from giving them a 5. Our room was pretty dated. Which is ok, because we don't spend much time in the room. The bathroom was the most outdated. I did kill a cockroach in the bathroom. But you do have to expect roaches in a humid enviornment, right? That's what I kept telling myself anyways! I don't bring any lugguge into my house until everything is went through and goes straight to the washing machine. And boy am I glad I do this. My kids bought wooden drums at the market on the beach (to the left of the hotel a ways down) and when I got home and was going through our things there were 6 cockroaches in the drums. I am thinking (and praying) those were in the drums when we bought them? We bought them our last night there. So please be mindful of these things when you come back from vacation! Our building was 30 and it was right on the beach and we could see the ocean from our balcony. But we were also beside the neighboring resort and I had to yell at the restaurant kitchen help one night to be quiet because my kids couldnt sleep. Some rooms have a private cabana and some have hot tubs. You could probably call or email them your request!", "Service: Check in was a little slow. We were tired and starving and just wanted to get to our room. The restaurant waiters could sometimes be a little on the slow side too. But it didn't bother us.", "Juan at the sunrise bar was awesome and so friendly! Bring your own bubba cup, yeti etc. and they will fill those up for you. Its better than the paper cups that get watered down really quick. I didnt do the royal service or the reserve and had a wonderful trip! I would return to this resort in a heartbeat!!!!"]},

Just a beautiful resort in so many ways: lots of nature - big mature palm trees provide shade from the sun and the gardens throughout the site are expertly maintained. The whole resort is just breathtaking when you walk around. Other resorts nearby just weren't up to the same level of maintenance. If you can afford Royal Service, try do it. It's so helpful to have a butler - he's really an on-site personal vacation manager - he made reservation changes for us and assisted us in changing our room on day two. Our butler was Miguel. Excellent butler. Very thoughtful and acted promptly; he often commented that \"this is your vacation\". Royal Service enables access to La Palapa restaurant - excellent small restaurant on the beach - excellent food and great service from Quintina and her staff. It's quiet, not like the main buffet restaurant which is busy. Also went to Passion - extra-cost restaurant - for their tasting menu. Go there. It's an experience to have each plate described and enjoyed in a beautiful setting. Great nightly entertainment from the Activation teams. Beach was groomed every day - minimal seaweed.

It is buffet service and my only regret is that it wasn't available for dinner too. I cannot fault it or the staff who were lovely. Lunch is occasionally offered down on the beach with a particular theme and there are one or two places to get snacks too.", "Dinner - this was ok but not really good enough for a 5 star hotel. There are 5 main restaurants for the evening - plus one more if you are in the Privilege section of the hotel - but for us the Mexican one was always closed and although they did put on a Mexican night on the lawn area - it was not well attended. At least one of the restaurants were closed every night and one night 2 were.  Service was good, except for one occasion when we waited for over half an hour for a main course (usually it was less than 10 mins) and then the steak was not that hot.   Strangely nearly every main course was very limited on vegetables, including one Chow Mein dish that was 95% meat and practically nothing else at all except some rice served separately.  A couple occasions when we ate a bit late the portions of certain aspects of the main courses looked very limited and very different when we had the same dish a different night.   Having said all that the food was pretty tasty and the service generally very good.", "There are number of fixed thatched umbrellas down on the beach (beach towels are provided from a couple of stations) and it is generally quieter down on the beach with more of a breeze. You will get visited both at the pool and beach by someone who will get you whatever drink you want. The beach is very sandy and others mention the seaweed problem but it is regularly cleared away. The sea itself is no more than waist deep and you can walk out to the barrier that keeps most of the seaweed back and that walk is about 200 metres. You can use canoes, paddle boards and Hoby Cats provided by the hotel.", "Tipping - this was very inconsistent from what I could see. Some people tip at dinner, less often at drink service and some don't at all. We preferred to reward specific people at the end of our stay rather than leave a couple of dollars at each meal.", "Extras - in two words - very expensive. You get free wine and it is pretty good. If you want to pay for something better - the cheapest was $38 and most were $50-100.

Yes they do a few deals but it is still over priced.", "Tips - if you want to reduce the cost of a trip or massage - accept the invitation to have a presentation to join a membership scheme run by the hotel that gives significant discounts if you use their facilities regularly. Membership covers 25, 10 or 5 years. Didn't suit us. But might do for those of you who use all-inclusive hotels regularly. If the two of you sit through the presentation and breakfast with your host (took about 2 hours) they will give you $150 dollar voucher to use against a tour or massage etc.", "Get to the beach relatively early to get a spot with an umbrella, they are limited.

I relied heavily on all the previous trip advisor reviews and can tell you that the staff is amazing and everyone goes out of their way to make you feel at home.  Our butler Steve's was awesome.  He arranged for a romantic dinner for us on the beach which was perfect.  Beach service, bar service and restaurants were all excellente.  Our favorites were the Italian, Mexican, hibachi and Rosewater place.  Special shout out to Alba on the beach, Willie Wonka and our great bartender at the preferred bar (can't remember his name).  He poured drinks on his shoulder!  Drinks are all top shelf.  We loved our Dominican water, Presidente beer!  We met some great folks in the lobby bar and had a blast.  As far as the entertainment goes, its very low key.  We went to one show which was meh.  If you want nightlife and party all night this is not the place for you.  If you want to relax and chill .... this is the place for you.  The Dominican people are genuinely happy to have you in their country.  We ventured out of the resort twice.  One for golf and another time for a snorkeling trip on the Hispanola.  The golf was o.k. and very expensive.  Would definately recommend booking through the resort as there was a mix up with the transportation.  On our way back from golfing my husband left his wallet in the cab.  Only $40 bucks in it but ID and credit cards in it.  To our surprise it was returned within the hour intact!!  Definately recommend the Hispanola snorkeling trip which you do have to book on your own.  Great staff and lunch.  I would pass on the \"vacation club\" speel though.  When you check in you are given a bunch of coupons.  You can only activate them if you agree to attend their presentation.  Took about 2 hours out of our day that we didn't plan on.  Definately would recommend paying for the preferred club.  Can't wait to go back.  If you are on the fence about this place don't be .  Book it !  You won't be disappointed."]},

There were more than enough loungers for everyone, never had a issue finding any...it has a fruit bar where you can freely get fresh fruit all day long, a bar and a newly constructed pier; security is great there, at least 3 guards on the beach alone any many throughout the property 24/7. The grounds are beautiful, sort of a jungle feel that opens up to a beautiful beach. Food is great as well, we ate at all the restaurants, Mediterranean, French, Italian, Japanese, steakhouse as well as the buffet (our favs were the Japanese and the steakhouse) and absolutely loved the pizza at the pizza hut; our only disappointment concerning food, was there was no bacon at breakfast, but many, many other options. Also there were only 1 or 2 restaurants opened at supper time (best time to go for supper is around 6:30-7:00) Our room was clean, air conditioning worked fine and no shortage of hot water.

I\u2019m quite a fussy eater and the Food was decent on the whole. the buffets seemed fairly typical holiday all inclusive buffets, quantity over quality. The best bits of the buffet are maned by chefs, for example freshly made eggs or the fresh juice/smoothie bar in the morning, and pasta bar in the evening, I wasn\u2019t really a fan of the stuff served in the metal containers. We tried to stick to a La Carte restaurants for dinner as they were significantly better. The a la cartes were included in the all inclusive and not extra money apart from the lobster meal on the beach. We Really enjoyed the Japanese restaurant, tepenyaki style, a chef cooks in front of you, we had sushi, fried rice, veg, teriyaki meats and sea food which was nice. I have seen a lot of negativity about reservations of restaurants but from what I know, the only one you have to book reserve is the Japanese, even then we managed to get in on 2 occasions as a couple in our 7 night stay just asking if they could fit us in that evening without a reservation. The others you just turn up and wait, the max we waited was 20 mins once. Really liked the snack bar which is by the pool which makes fresh pizzas all day.", "Drinks for us were disappointing, I know it\u2019s common when all inclusive but everything is so watered down. The cocktails, local spirits, even wine were weak and watery. Everywhere apart from the restaurants and lobby they are served in tiny single use plastic cups.

Not a bad place (geographically) but far from what is expected from an all-inclusive in the DR. Bottom line, it seems that management at this resort believes in getting the most out of a customer while only giving back as much as it can with a skeleton staff. There is no pool service, beach service or a well trained customer service staff anywhere on property. Don't get me wrong, they're friendly, but friendliness doesn't equal to good customer service. Don't pay for the VIP..it isn't worth it. You still don't get the service, you don't receive anything special, you even have to pay for WIFI service. They don't have the premier liquors at every bar, so if you pay for the VIP package and want a top shelf beverage, you'll be forced to walk to the bar that does stock it or wait up to 10 minutes for someone else to fetch it. Weird. Rooms service is garbage. VIP gets you access to the room service option but you still have to pay for most items on the menu...wait...what? So buying the VIP package allows me to call for room service and ask for crackers but if I want a sandwich I have to pay $10 for it? Sorry. Overall this property has potential, but the current managerial process and sleepy service will keep me away and I would not recommend it to others. I have stayed at many all-inclusive resorts in the DR. I have given many a chance to impress me and only one has so far and this was far from positively impressing me. I think that the activities staff tries hard but would likely do even better if they didn't constantly ask guests to fetch drinks for them.....especially during the night time functions."]},

We were in block 4 (room 4205) and our maid Elizabeth was fantastic at her job. The level of cleanliness at this resort is phenomenal, really phenomenal, I can not praise it enough. When you have finished eating your plates etc are taken away almost immediately, this ensures there are no flies around food at any time. ", "I can only find a few flaws at this beautiful resort, and none of these are to do with any staff, but senior management should look at the following to make the experience truly 5 star instead of four star +. The furniture around the beach bar urgently needs replacing, some of the tall bar stools have bare and worn patches where you could easily sit and fall through, it is very obvious and disappointing. The WiFi in the reception is very slow, and if you pay for the in-room Wifi it is a waste of money as it does not work. Some of the furniture in our honeymoon suite was in need of repair. The clothes drawers were very stiff indeed, tatty and in need of replacing, as was the door on the mini-fridge. Small points but they need addressing to make this a truly special five star. Saying all this our room was really lovely, the bed was very comfortable and the shower room was truly awesome with a really powerful shower and his and her sinks. All eleven of our party (Six from USA, three from Ireland and two from the UK) had a truly memorable time, we all absolutely loved it and would 100% return to this wonderful resort. The beaches are also fabulous and we walked it every day. You do not get hassled by any vendors, and those that are there leave you alone with a polite \"no thank you\". If you turn left onto the beach you will find vendor shops and stalls about 10/15 minutes along, again they leave you alone if you politely say \"no thank you\". If you turn right onto the beach you can walk for miles and it is beautiful, plus you can stop off at the other hotels in this chain and have food and drink if you like, it is a wonderful experience. I would like to thank all the management from Punta Cana, they are obvious in their shirts and ties, they supervise everything discreetly and are so polite and friendly to all their staff alike, it is lovely to see such a happy workforce. Thank you Punta Cana, a brilliant holiday, but please address the furniture issues and the Wifi, my only negatives."]},

The cleaning staff is constantly policing the area for any empty cups or trash making sure that the pool area is always nice.

The only other complaint was the outdoor bar stools at the high top tables in the beach bar... definitely need replaced but the large areas with the thatched roofs were very fun to hang out in, not to mention all the couches and the hanging swing chairs.", "All in all it was one of the best all-inclusive resorts we have ever been to.

{"hotel": ["TRS Turquesa Hotel"], "title": ["Amazing 25tb Anniversary Vacation!!!"], "content": ["My husband and I had the most amazing 25tb wedding anniversary trip at the TRS Turquesa in Punta Cana, DR in May 2019! It is an adults-only all-inclusive and it was absolutely beautiful! The beach and pools are awesome! Our trip was made extra special by an amazing employee, our butler, King-Kong!! This is his nick-name, but how everyone knows him. He took care of everything and anything we needed during our week long stay (see attached picture)! We enjoyed the trip and the resort so much that we are already planning to return again next year and bringing some friends with us. We will be requesting that King-Kong is our Butler again for sure!! The resort is beautiful, we had amazing weather, and the food is very good and there is an incredible variety of restaurants on the resort as well. We loved the Japanese Steakhouse the best. There is a lot to do if you want to be busy and off-resort excursions that you can take advantage of if you like. There is also the ability to just do nothing if that is your preference, which we did a lot of. The swim up & pool-side bars were great and you had access to whatever types of drinks/alcohol you could want during your stay. Plenty of alcohol available in your room as well, if you want it. Also, the rooms are large & beautiful, probably about 3 times the size of a regular hotel room. If I had to give one constructive piece of feedback, I would have liked to have been able to control the a/c temp more in our room. It was definitely cool at all times, but my husband and I are used to being able to have the a/c in our house quite low at night when we sleep. But, I think this is mostly an American thing. I don\u2019t think most of the rest of the world keeps their  a/c as low as Americans sometimes do. There were many other members of the staff that also made our trip special, but i am really bad with names, but my husband will also be posting a review and he will mention those staff as well. All of the staff were friendly and always helpful. One piece of advice - eventhough it is an all-inclusive resort, plan to tip. If you want/get great service, tip accordingly. Tip generously. Also, learn some basic Spanish, everyone appreciates it if you at least try to speak the native language. You don\u2019t need to know a lot, but basic greetings and responses are helpful. Most of the staff speak English, but some have limited English. Again, it was an awesome trip and we booked with Apple Vacations and they also did an amazing job! Thank you to Janet at Freeport Travel for helping us to arrange the trip!!  We will use Janet & Freeport Travel for all of our future trips!"]},

The drinks were delicious and plentiful. Kevin and Manuel at the lobby bar and Luis our server took great care of us. Alfonso at Helios makes one of the best martinis I have ever had. The service at the restaurants was good, but everyone wanted you to order your entire meal right away. Eventually, we were able to persuade them to order appetizers then main course later. The best service we had was at La Boheme, with Noemi. She was very accommodating and friendly.The resort is beautiful and the grounds amazing. The best part of the trip was the staff. Everyone was friendly. I want to especially thank Providencia and her staff in Bldg 58. She, Cesario and Amerigo were great. Every morning, afternoon and night they checked on you as you left or came back. Providencia was our go to problem solver. She made a point of asking everyday, Como Esta?.

When we got there we were told we were close to the lobby (opposite from the beach) and had 2 twin beds.

I am a vegetarian and I found a lot of options I could have. The staff was very friendly and smiley. TIP YOUR HOUSE KEEPER WELL! They do such a nice job of making the room beautiful and even decorate it with flowers and cute towel animals.", "Cons: although the beach is beautiful, the water is only kind of clear. The sand is so soft that the waves pick it up and makes it not that clear. You are allowed to put your chairs wherever you want, even in the ocean, which gets annoying because even being in the front row of chairs, your view ends up getting blocked by people who want to sit closer. No one cleans up the chairs at night and in the morning they're just scattered all over the place. The pool is small and the bottom of it is a little jagged, my boyfriend cut both of his hands on it. The resort does need to be updated. The people trying to sell you stuff on the beach is out of hand. I know that it happens everywhere you go, but I've stayed at 3 different resorts and they've never been this bad. Some times it felt like every 15 seconds someone was bugging you about buying something. It felt a little hard to relax when that's all you hear. The shows were not good. They seemed very amateur and it seemed like the same show every night. There is not a lot going on by the beach/pool like there has been at other resorts. They have mini games and stuff, but it seems to be the same thing every day. The staff at the buffets would sometimes not come check on you/ask you if you wanted anything to drink for long periods of time, which was frustrating. It got better towards the end of the trip. No one really came around the pool/beach to see if you wanted anything. People sitting at booths by the pool trying to sell you excursions were pushy and didn't leave you alone. We went on an excursion through Apple Vacations were you dune buggied and swam in a man made waterfall. BRING GOOGLES (or at the very least sunglasses) and a bandana, they didn't tell us that beforehand and I had to give my boyfriend my sunglasses so he could see while he drove and the dust was SO BAD that I had my eyes shut most of the time. Also, they take you on a main road with big trucks beeping at you and flying past you which was scary. And we stop at a beach which was dirty and they told us that's where people used to do cocaine deals...? The waterfall was pretty, but very obviously fake. I would avoid that excursion.

I have been to many all inclusive resorts in the Caribbean and Mexico. It is fair to say that TRS Cap Cana has been my best experience in an all inclusive adult only resort.", "We booked a room with the swim up pool. The room was very spacious, clean, and modern. The bed was beyond comfortable and always had fresh sheets on it after each day. The bathroom was a highlight of our stay: our room had the rainfall shower head with the right pressure and correct hot temperature. It was a great addition to have L\u2019Occitane shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotion refilled everyday. L\u2019Occitane is not inexpensive and I appreciated the little things that make this resort great. The swim up pool was a VERY GOOD decision. It is very relaxing to start the morning off with a quick swim or to lay out on a floating bed to soak up the Dominican sun. Our neighbors at the resort were all very nice and we found ourselves talking to them for hours at the swim up pool in the balcony of our rooms. We also had drink service to swim up pool so there was no need to go to the main pool to get drinks and be at the pool.", "We had a personal butler during our trip at TRS Cap Cana. His name is Mariano and he went above and beyond to make sure our stay in the Dominican Republic was perfect. He made himself accessible at all hours of the day and even gave us his WhatsApp number and told us to reach out to him at ANY time if we needed anything. He helped us make restaurant reservations, book excursions, and was a smiling face that we would talk to every time we passed him by in the hotel. Mariano even set up a surprise one night for my girlfriend and I where he created a pathway of rose petals that led to a heart of rose petals and the bed with a bottle of white wine. He also helped us set up a romantic dinner on the sky terrace of the hotel during sun set - that experience was invaluable and will be something My spouse and I will remember forever.", "My girlfriend and I, absolutely fell in love with all the employees at TRS Cap Cana. Most specifically: Johana, Starling, and Angelica. These people are bartenders and made our experience in TRS the best ever. The aforementioned people knew our orders by the second day we have arrived. They all suggested drinks for us to try that they would make specifically for us. What stood out to me about these people is the quality of the conversations that we had. We would converse for hours throughout the day about any topic under the sun. We laughed and smiled with them all throughout our trip. My spouse and I, truly miss these people because they made our trip very great. Words can\u2019t express the happiness I felt when I got to understand the lives of the people in the Dominican through these workers. We are all now Facebook friends and I will Make sure to keep tabs of them! They were the best", "Finally, the food! The food was very good. My girlfriend and I loved eating at gaucho: their Argentinian steak house. It was a pleasure to order high quality cuts of lamb, ribeye, and even lobster. The portioning size was very satisfying and I found myself ordering two plates because it was SO GOOD. The other restaurant, Izakaya (Japanese) was very good. At Izakaya, they really put an emphasis on presentation and the quality of the food. They had many authentic dishes on the menu and it did not disappoint. We were even served sushi that was dressed in apple wood chip smoke through the burning of a blow torch - truly an experience. In the morning, gaucho turns into a breakfast - lunch spot. It is a combination of buffet and a la carte. It was always great to kick of the morning with quality meats and cheeses. Helios: their restaurant on the beach that serves Mediterranean and Italian food was beyond perfect. I tried something new there every day.", "Thank you TRS Cap Cana and the Palladium hotel group for making our stay wonderful."]},

The permanent site of the French restaurant was being remodeled so they did a little shuffling of restaurants leaving the Mexican restaurant offering unavailable.

Use the in-room electronic pads to communicate changes in schedules more effectively, for instance, the \"pop-up\" Mexican restaurant and occasional closings of other spaces for private events (which should be minimized by the way);", "2.  Consider purchasing dehumidifiers for the swim out suites.   The climate is humid enough but with a pool right outside the door the room got more than a little \"musty\".  Portable dehumidifiers are inexpensive and would help with this; and", "3.  Accentuate the \"last day\" experience.

On the downside...our room did not get cool enough at night and the hotel is a $70 taxi ride from the airport and a $35 taxi ride if you want to go to the Casino at the Hard Rock Hotel. Otherwise we had a great stay and I would recommend this hotel."]},

I had gone back and forth on a first look but all of my friends that did it loved it and most of their best pictures were from that special moment. It was supposed to start at 4:40 at this big beautiful tree on the resort then to the ceremony at 5. I'm not sure if I was supposed to be keeping track of time or who but this is not what happened. Kenny was amazing and not upset that he took his time with the getting ready pictures but it ended up running through our entire first look time. The location got changed for the look to one of the least scenic areas on the resort (probably because less people around) and was more of an after thought and rush because we didn't do it until 5. So our long intimate special moment turned into a rushed moment with about 6 pictures before we had to get to the ceremony and just ended up ruining the moment in general. It was great to see my groom and we were super happy but if I would've known it was going to be turned into a rushed after thought I would've saved that moment for the ceremony. We will never get that back. Oh well! The beach ceremony was perfect! I couldn't have dreamt up a better wedding really. ", "Reception- Was on the Bordeaux terrace.

It was nice to have someone announce us coming in and say a few things but other than that besides the songs we suggested, most of their own choices were not good.

They stopped playing and one of them went to a manager. Hopefully that will change. We live in Las Vegas where these things would not happen.

{"hotel": ["Excellence El Carmen"], "title": ["A lovely Resort (but nothing is Perfect)"], "content": ["My wife and I just returned from a weeks stay at Excellence El Carmen, Punta Cana, Uvero Alto.  From the Airport it is about a 50 minute drive. We arrived with Air Transat direct from Halifax, a charter flight that like most Airlines are focused on quantity rather than quality. As most that fly know, todays airlines are focused on profit more than comfort. Upgrading to Club class is no longer worth the extra money. Priority boarding going to the Dominican out of Halifax was fine, coming home not even a single effort to provide any priority service. Shuffle like cattle, like a heard of humans all in the name of 'who cares!'  Gathering our luggage and finding our shuttle was no problem, we arrived about 9:30 and we were ready to begin our much needed break!  As we waited for any additional passengers to board our shuttle, we did what one should do on their vacation and have a Presidente beer! Ok, so it's early, however since we were up at 4, our day was definitely started! The improvements to the roads from the first time we went to the Dominican (over 20 years ago) have improved immensely, once upon a time it would have taken a couple of hours. Arriving at the hotel we were greeted and taken to the Excellence Club check in. We choose to take this upgraded service because when you only have a week holiday, one should do what they can to make it the best possible! I do recommend this level of service if you can afford it. Overall, we were pleased we did, for the extra investment, it is worth it, I'll explain why as you read on. Arriving early has no guarantee that your room will be ready, in fact ours wasn't. Come prepared, pack a bathing suit in a carry on, leave your luggage and go out and enjoy yourself. We went for a bite to eat at the Las Olas beach restaurant, wanting to see the beach as soon as possible. This is a basic burger, hotdog, pizza kind of place with wonderful view but disappointing food. (That was our only visit to this restaurant) Usually my wife and I would often have our lunches as close to the beach as possible, however the food was less than appealing. Once finished we became familiar with our surroundings and waited until 3:30 to return for our room. Our next stop, Bar Sol, a quaint outdoor bar for a refreshing drink. Back to the Excellence Club lounge to get our room. We were in building 5, on the second floor overlooking the ocean. Our room was spacious and clean, with a welcome bottle of bubbly, a welcome letter and some fresh fruit. In the room we had s small bar and a decently stocked mini fridge. The bathroom has a stand up shower two sinks and amenities that cover just about anything you may have forgotten. The bed was a king and if you want to change your pillow there is a selection of options. Our shower was pleasant with a rain head and a hand held, however the drain was clogged and began to over flow. This was rectified once we informed them. As we still didn't know our way around the resort very well, we went looking for the restaurant area and found most were convenient and no need to make reservations. We chose The Grill for our first dinner. Again disappointed my wife's steak (Tenderloin) was tough and hard to cut, she could not eat it, I had the Rib eye, (underwhelming) with too much fat, as well thin and tasteless. Off to the typical entertainment at 9:30. Michael Jackson show, we must have seen (over the years) about 10 of these shows, my first thought was this act is tired and now over done, especially with the controversy regarding his legacy. I will say, it had to be one of the better performances we have seen. ", "The next morning we were ready for the beach. A beautiful beach with Palm Trees and plenty of areas to relax in a shaded area. There was a constant breeze that was welcomed with temperatures hovering around 28 Celsius (high 80's for our American friends). Because we upgraded to Club class, we had specific area (if we chose) where we were afforded extra amenities. Mildred became our morning smile who set our towels, offered us juice, water or just about anything you needed. She was pleasant, knew our names and very kind. There were plenty of things to do if you want that kind of holiday but my wife and I wanted nothing but peace and quiet, which was exactly what we got! Other than the typical beach vendors looking to sell you just about anything, for the most part they did not hound you. Each morning we went for a walk, usually turning left facing the beach, about 25 minutes we came upon the other Excellence resort, a little older, but doing a multi million dollar upgrade. Also a beautiful beach. We found the Excellence Club was excellent to deal with, they were always friendly and willing to help. I wanted to celebrate my wife's birthday while we were away and made a special request to reserve Chez Isabelle, they were accommodating and provided a cake with candle. Wanting to make her day a little more special, I asked concierge in building 5 if he would arrange to have our hot tub filled when we returned from the beach as well provide some cheese crackers to make her day a little more pleasant. Unfortunately NOTHING was followed up and we came back to the room, I was more than disappointed. Another annoyance was often when we were getting ready for dinner, between 5:30 & 7, we would have several knocks on our door, room fresh, an afternoon sweet for club class, etc. Although this was appreciated, the timing was not good!  One more comment about the room service, more than once we had not face cloths. When I finally made a comment, they were quick to bring us them.", "The entertainment staff were pleasant, however often they would roam the beach professing their nick names, often asking patrons to mention them in their reviews or hash tagging them. I do not see the point of this (although, I know why) other than telling you about the evening shows, and making small chit chat, they really didn't explain or invite you to participate in the many resort activities. Our best experiences for food and pleasantries came when we were in the Excellence Club, Magna was wonderful, Yonatan, the bartender was exceptionally pleasant and very accommodating.", "Generally we had a very good holiday and will visit Excellence properties again.

It turned out to be a language problem because other \"included\" wines were available by the glass or the bottle. We ended up paying $50 for that bottle (after conversion, tip and taxes) and never even finished it.

I'm not sure if other reviews warn about the rooms not facing the pool, but be aware, they are awful. They face the road and you will hear carts (shuttle buses the hotel takes guests on), scooters (used by staff), and other loud noises late into the night and early morning. We were on the side facing the edge of the hotel's property and could hear thumping music from the adjacent hotel all night long. They made no effort to honor our request. Clearly they don't value return customers.

We figured \"why not,\" arranged for my mother to babysit the kids, and scheduled for our dinner. Pasion is a tasting menu--of the ten courses, about three were edible. I am a seafood lover, but this was the most fishy, inedible seafood I had ever tasted. At the end of an unnecessarily long (3 hour) dinner, I was presented with a bill for $160 ($80 per person). I mentioned to the waiter that we had been offered dinner for free, and he looked at me and said to speak to the management. I was upset and angry and immediately conveyed what had happened to our Family Concierge. She said she would look into it. After asking her day after day about this, I spoke with the Concierge manager.  What they failed to mention, was that what we were offered was a three course \"sampling\" of Pasion. I explained that I felt completely tricked into eating at this horrible restaurant. After going around and around, they wound up charging us half. I made it clear that I didn\u2019t think was a satisfactory resolution - they did not seem to care what I think. While this was my personal story, it reflects on the overall experience at Paradisus\u2014they will try to \u201csell\u201d every minute of the day. Quietly sitting by the pool, you'll be hounded by salespeople trying to book family photo sessions (many of who didn't politely take no for an answer). Waiters wanting to bring you \"drinky drinky\" so that they'll earn a tip. The whole place just feels like everyone is hustling.

Only other thing I did not like was when you are at the beach the guys selling jewelry or excursions DO NOT STOP talking to you and hounding you. Can be too much when you are just trying to relax. Magna was great for breakfast, service was good. Best service was at the steakhouse for dinner, he went out of his way to make a drink they did not have. He actually ran to the coffee house to make my boyfriend an expresso martini. Food was not bad either. Pools were great, pool bar service was great as well. Italian was by far THE BEST restaurant. There lunches and dinners are unreal. Their seafood risotto was the best I have ever had in my life and the service there is great. Asian food was our second favorite although the service there is very slow. The last night there we did the romantic dinner on the beach.

You did have to walk through the seaweed to get into the Ocean.  It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal to me, but I know that it is important to a lot of people.  The service at the Excellence Club beach was just okay.  A waitress came by maybe every hour, hour and 15 minutes, and it took a good 20 minutes or so for her to come back with a drink.

Love the options of the Italian and Lobster house for lunch.  The food at Las Olas was junk, burgers and pizza etc.  The breakfast buffet was just okay.  We would have to request eggs be cooked longer, and at all restaurants ask for the meat to be cooked well done (which looked like medium).  I didn\u2019t like that most of the restaurants were clustered together.  I would\u2019ve rather have them spread out amongst the resort.", "That being said, however we did get sick, the first time in 7 all inclusive visits.

The transfer from the airport was 30 minutes (or less) the staff welcomed us and we were able to check in immediately.  I had emailed the property in advance to ask for a quiet room and for something nice to celebrate my husband for his birthday.  They upgraded us to a 'romance suite' in the privileged section and I was so happy...the rooms were newly renovated and very sweet...my favourite part was the hammock on the balcony. We even received a lovely fresh fruit basket and champagne.  The facilities were very clean and quaint.  We were not in the adults only section but it was not a bother, there was plenty of pathways and quiet spaces to feel like we were.  We tried every restaurant, the nice thing was you didn't need a reservation BUT for the Japanese one you have to go a bit early, i's the most popular...unless you don't mind eating a little later.  The only restaurant we were not keen on was Yuca - the Caribbean one, it was small portions and not the tastiest (this could just have been us)!

We didn't' watch much of the entertainment as we went out early every day for golf.  The course was lovely and we never felt super rushed.  The only unfortunate thing is that even though the golf is included (1 round per person per day) you have to pay $45 USD per person for the cart...and you do not have a choice.  I think it would have been more appropriate to not charge...but if you are then charge per couple!

This was our FIRST waste of time and money. A customer service rep in the front lobby apologized and told us someone would pick us up from our room at 9am the next morning to treat us to an exclusive breakfast. The next day comes and we wait outside until 9:30 and no one shows. Later that day we stopped in the lobby to talk to the same customer service rep to find out why we were stood up. The same rep apologized and invited us on a \"tour of the property\", we foolishly agreed. The so-called \"tour\" was a drive from the lobby to the Travel Club office, where sales people try to suck you in to buying expensive memberships. We were told we would have to spend 90 minutes listening to a presentation and tour. When we told Sandra (one of the managers) that we would not be spending any money to become members of the travel club she instantly became very rude and stormed away from the table. Needless to say my husband and I left after filling out the survey about the presentation. Later that day we decided to visit the beach where a man with a parrot asked us if we would like to take pictures (using our own phones). I asked how much it cost and he told me $10 per person. Once he took pictures of my husband and I, he claimed that we owed him $80 !!!! We became very upset and left the beach shorty after. We went to our room and decided to relax there for a few hours. We called the operator to request something to be sent room, and we were told that they would bring them quickly. An hour went by and no one had came so we called back and asked again. Hours went by and no one ever came to the room at all with what we requested. On Wednesday we woke up around 8am and I went to take a shower. Once I was in the shower for a few minutes, the water completely shut off including the sinks and jacuzzi upstairs. I was covered in soap and had to rise off with a cold water bottle from the fridge. At this point I was furious and went to the Bavaro lobby to speak with a manager to express my frustrations. The guest services manager Carlos partnered with associate Masiel to compensate us. He offered us a \"spa package\" and Massiel told us it included massages. We left the lobby happy and got ready to go to the spa. Once arrived we were told that we were only granted access to the pools in the back but nothing else was included so if we wanted massages we would have to pay. Since our stay was very short and we were running out of time we wanted to treat ourselves. We decided to book the most expensive romantic dinner package on the beach in the gazebo for 9pm. When we arrived later that night the gazebo table was already occupied so we were placed at the regular table in the sand. When we asked the server why he had no idea about who was scheduled at each time, he was just there to serve the tables. Thursday morning it was time for us to check out and I had spoke to Massiel about the issue with our table. She went in the back to speak to a manager and their conclusion was to offer a free upgrade for our next stay there (Which is pointless because we will never stay at this resort again). They refused to refund me for a single dollar for all my money and time that was lost. After I returned home I reached out to Maria Razzi from customer care and she basically gave me a big F.U., stating that there was no record of the water being shut off in the building, and that we were already taken care of by Carlos. If you stay at this resort you are taking a chance that your money and time is well spent. DON'T BOTHER! If you experience any problems MANAGEMENT WILL NOT COMPENSATE YOU."]},
{"hotel": ["Grand Palladium Bavaro Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["BIG Resort, clean grounds, food is good but not great"], "content": ["We had the roof top jacuzzi suite which is nice to have some space to spread out.  Bathrooms are open style so not much privacy.  The resort, combined with the three sister resorts is HUGE and takes a while to understand the layout.  After a couple days we realized that the buffet at the next door resort was much closer than ours.  Breakfast buffet was good with plenty of options.  Lunch was decent with a guy grilling up lamb chops on the beach, plenty of options.  The specialty restaurant experience was disappointing.  Our first attempt at the steak house was a 2 hour wait, so we opted for the buffet.  The second attempt was a 1 hour wait so we passed the time talking to a young couple from Switzerland - there are lots of Europeans vacationing here.  The ribeye steak was barely 1/2 thick and cooked too well.  The waiter was entertaining though.  Our third attempt was the Argentinian restaurant.  We were told it would be about a 25 minute wait.  After 1 hour and 15 minutes,  I gave back the beeper and headed to the buffet.  While the buffet is redundant and there is not much atmosphere, they offer everything under the sun to eat, the quality is good, not great and I agree that some of the sanitary practices are not up to par.  My best meal was at the sports bar - a buffet of pizza, nachos and chicken wings and a menu to order sandwiches and light dinners - much like the room service menu.  There are plenty of bars around and the bartenders are very friendly.  If you are looking forward to the casino, you will be disappointed, there are a couple of tables and about 20 slots - very small.  Each lobby bar has a band playing at night so you will be able to find some entertainment. This resort would be good for larger or multiple families traveling together.  We typically stay and smaller more intimate resorts and we will most likely go back to that."]},

Room service was good and timely. The resort offers a buffet for breakfast and lunch which offers a lot of variety. I would consider the food offered via room service and the buffet to be on the better side of \"hotel food.\" The food is not outstanding, but there are good options to be had. There are also several restaurants on site. We tried The Lobster House (seafood), Oregano (Italian), Chez Isabelle (French) and Flavor Market (tapas). Flavor Market was very good, while Chez Isabelle had nice atmosphere, the food was not quite up to par with what I expected and some dishes were not very French. Our only bad dining experience was at The Lobster House. The portion sizes for the appetizers were very small (example, 2 tiny shrimp in the Shrimp Cocktail appetizer). The lobster tails were not fresh and tasted like they had been frozen for too long. We tried both grilled and boiled lobster tails and they were very dried out with little flavor.  ", "The Spa: The spa services are not usually included in the All-Inclusive package, but they do offer specials every day. We booked a couple of massages, which also come with their hydrotherapy treatment and we were very happy with both our massages and the hydrotherapy experience (which is a series of hot and cold water experiences both in and out of a pool, and a sauna and a steam room, amongst others. Its a very interesting experience I recommend. You can opt out of any stage of the hydrotherapy circuit if you find the activity uncomfortable (example, some people don't like hot steam rooms or saunas).", "The overall experience was very good and we would definitely return; however we found there are a few areas where this resort could go from being very good to outstanding. 1. The in-room toiletry products are very bland and didn't feel very luxurious at all. We think they should consider upgrading these to something nicer. 2. The Lobster House restaurant would be outstanding if they would offer fresher seafood (especially the Lobster). We had fresh seafood at the buffet so why not at the seafood restaurant? Also, 2 tiny 2-inch shrimp in a shot glass does not make a shrimp cocktail. Sure we could have ordered more but isn't that just wasting more dishes and water to clean them? 3. They sell very nice-smelling coffee in their shops onsite but none of the coffee served either in the main buffet area nor in the coffee shop had much, if any, flavor to it. Grind some fresh beans and offer some tastier coffee. Make it memorable for your guests. Little things like this make a big difference in the enjoyment of a relaxing stay."]},

The beach is not perfect, yes there is some seaweed but the guys are raking and collecting it as best they can. There is a bit of rough spots at first BUT, follow the clear blue path out to some gorgeous clear pools, a lovely little trail between the sandbars, you can literally walk the ocean rather than the beach if you choose. Water is crystal clear and you don't even need a mask to see fish. We took out the hobie cats and wonderful sailing, so enjoyable! We did not opt to upgrade but many do, a few more luxury perks maybe but we were there for the water, beach and sunshine mostly so everyone can enjoy that. Safe travels! "]},

Our room was a Privileged Suite. This resort is about 20 minutes (23 km) from airport, check in was 5-10 minutes, front desk staff were friendly, knowledgeable and spoke multiple languages. Our room was clean and matched the hotel website description. Staff at this resort work hard and we everyone to be friendly and helpful. Overall the food quality was average, lots of choices at the buffet and comparable to other Dominican Republic (similar rated resorts) that we have visited several times in the Dominican. We found that here was ample beach and pool lounge chairs, although most of the best shaded locations were taken by 6 am. Our favorite restaurant was by far the Japanese restaurant, the 3 other restaurants we ate at wasn\u2019t as good as the buffet due wide selection of various local food. The bar in our room was stocked daily. This is a family resort, there were many folks with their children, however they tended to stay close to the main pools while we stayed in the beach privilege area, so it wasn\u2019t an issue for us. All bars served local drinks, if you wanted non domestic we found them at the main lobby bar and the privileged area beach bar.", "Only have couple complaints, the beach bars wash used glasses right at the bar with local water and soap, they don\u2019t sterilize, just rinse and couple times we experienced soap taste in our drinks which may be reason we both experienced upset stomachs. The other issue we had was very loud disco type music from the Pearl Building, the base was cranked to max which rattled our windows in our room which faced the Pearl building. Based on past 4th visit to his resort, we recommend this resort to experienced travelers wanting good value, great service and problem free vacation."]},

When we arrived we were directed to the check in desk and issued a room.The place looked Grand! When we left the desk,that's when the Nightmare started.We were pointed in the direction of our room and the journey began.This place is massive and confusing.We walked around for thirty minutes and covered a 1/4 mile before finding our room.The room was on the second floor and there were no elevators.Four bags of luggage and and two flights of stairs we reached our room. As we entered I could smell mold right away.I opened the mini fridge to find in not working.The shower was the cause of the smell.I decided to wash up in the sink which didn't drain.We were dying of thirst and all we had was two bottles of warm water.No ice bucket in the room,I set out to find an Ice machine.I ended up walking to a pool bar and asking for some ice.Three staff folks looked at each other and one handed me a small glass of ice.Lol.I returned to the room to find my wife,who was not happy at all,tell me that the tv remote didn't work and the rest of the room was in despair and hadn't been cleaned properly.I slept well,my wife not so.We woke to sunshine and a breeze.The Grounds were beautiful.We were surprised to find we were close to the beach.How could such an outdated, poorly maintained room be in Paradise? We strolled back up to the entrance and boarded the bus only to find out we were not the only one with a horror story.Don't get me wrong,we were thankful to have somewhere to lay down after a 9 hour day at the airport.We just feel bad for your Resort...I know that was not the impression you wanted to give to potential guest."]},

", "We were a bit concerned it would just be a massive party hotel but in our experience it had the perfect balance of calm and party. ", "There were lots of activities and games around the pool and on the beach each day, all run by the fantastic vibe crew. These guys work tirelessly all day and night to make sure that guests are enjoying themselves all without being too in your face if you just wanted to sunbathe. Camel, Black Panther, Anaconda and Jean-Luis to name a few were amazing, they made such an effort to speak to you and remember who you are which gave the week such a personal feel. The foam parties (on Wednesdays and Saturdays) were HILARIOUS - a word of advice though, play tappy-tappy with Camel at your own risk!!!!!!!!!!! ", "In addition to the daytime entertainment there were shows each evening around the Lobby bar and Sports bar. These shows were brilliant and varied and again the Vibe team were fantastic at getting you up to dance! The Adult show (kind of cabaret/burlesque style) was a real laugh and the party and dancing afterwards was the best of the week by far!", "And if you think this wasn't enough there was a whole timetable of fitness classes running everyday with brilliant variety. The fitness crew - J Carlos, Favio and Yvonne - were amazing! I started off most of my days with sunrise yoga with Favio, these classes were blissful!! Looking out across the ocean with the sea breeze blowing across you is the most relaxing place to be! It's safe to say my yoga classes at my gym will certainly seem dull from now on! And then there was aqua zumba with J Carlos - this guy sure knows how to dance and make you laugh! My sister and I did most of the aqua classes each day as they were just so much fun to do, but again if you didn't want to join in there was no pushiness from anyone to be involved.", "The week wouldn't have been the same if these guys weren't there to entertain you!!", "And then there are the rest of the staff.... everyone we spoke to was so helpful. They couldn't do enough for you and it was practically impossible to clean up for yourself or do anything as strenuous as move a sun lounger without someone appearing to help you. They absolutely catered to our every need and coming home to do things yourself is certainly a shock to the system!", "We stayed in a Diamond club swim out room in building one, room 1111.

The sun stayed on our swim out until around 3/4pm and gave you the perfect vantage point to people watch and sunbathe at the same time!", "We didn't find these rooms too noisy at all, in face throughout the day the feel was pretty chilled with the odd blast of music when an activity was on. The only day I found a bit too noisy was Dominican day where they had music playing pretty much all day. However if this was too much you could move to the beach and it was quieter here.", "Perks of Diamond club is having butler service (our butlers were JJ and Joan and both were great) to make reservations for dinner for you and being able to go to Hunters Steakhouse for breakfast. We did the buffet the first day which was fine, but after going to Hunters and getting fabulous table service on the 2nd morning we went back every day for breakfast. By the end of the week the super staff knew what we were drinking without asking, another personal touch that goes a long way!", "A lot of people have said how pushy the time share people are or how in your face the excursion staff are trying to sell you trips but we didn't have any problems at all. No-one from a time share approached us and Hector from the excursion team spoke to us on our first day, we said we probably wouldn't do anything as we were only there for a week and he left us to it - in fact he remembered our names and said hello to us and asked how we were each day so should we have decided to do any trips we would have gone to him to book without a second thought.", "There were a few odd niggles - our shower tended to flood out as it was a wet room style, there is the odd bit of maintenance that could have be taken care of in the rooms such as a few chipped tiles or paintwork here and there but for us this presented no problem. We simply put a towel on the floor to mop up the water and e weren't there to infect the walls so this proved no issue to us. Depends how fussy you are I suppose! If you want glorious sunshine, great service, fab cocktails and the chance to meet new friends this is the place for you!", "Overall, we loved our whole stay so much so that we are already seriously considering booking and returning next year!!", "If you are considering CHIC then my advice would be to go!"]},

Breakfast was very good, but the lunch buffets were pretty bad (and we are not that picky).  We found that ordering room service for lunch was much better.  For dinner, the buffets were not good either.  In addition, at all of the buffets  the staff never got around to getting your beverages so you could eat your meal before your coffee or soda would arrive.    As for the a la carte restaurants we enjoyed the Japanese restaurant (you make reservations with guest services of the morning of the day before), Chinese restaurant and Mexican restaurants.

", "Our room was nice enough, but we had to upgrade after our first night to achieve this. The room we were given to start with was very disappointing. Ground floor, facing a building site, 2 small double beds crammed in, one tiny wardrobe, one small chest of drawers, no area to stash suitcases etc. No way as a family of 3 could we have survived 2 weeks in there. We paid an additional $550 (13 nights) the following day to upgrade to a suite, which was much better, but we did get the feeling we were deliberately given an awful room to start with to force us into doing this.", "The grounds, pool and beach were all nice enough....yes there\u2019s a bit of a seaweed issue on the beach, but there was a team of 3 who worked tirelessly throughout the day to minimise the impact and on the whole, they did a pretty decent job. It didn\u2019t bother us at all. We\u2019re not normally beach people and would usually favour sitting by the pool, but we liked the beach, the nice breeze you got and the fact it was less busy, so we spent a lot more time there than we usually would. There\u2019s a reef just on the edge of the safe swimming area too, so you can snorkel there and it\u2019s pretty good.

You can still find the odd free beds available throughout the day, just not in the areas you\u2019d choose to frequent.", "The restaurants are the biggest let down in this resort and for so many reasons. Firstly, you can\u2019t make a reservation for any of them, which isn\u2019t helpful if you\u2019ve got children. It basically means you have to arrive by 7.00pm to avoid having to wait. We found this out the hard way on our second night, when we went out about 8.00pm, to be told by one eatery (the Seaside Grill) there where 10 people waiting ahead of us, so we moved down to the next one (Oceana), to be told their were 15 people ahead of us! I have to say, both the staff we spoke to at the entrances to the restaurants were very unhelpful; they wouldn\u2019t give any indication of the waiting time and didn\u2019t divulge how the waiting system works (we later found out they give you a pager which they send a signal to when your table is free). Had they done so, we could have had a drink and waited or returned to our room for a bit, but no, we had to march to the other end of the resort and go to the World Cafe.", "Also, none of the restaurants have their menus up outside. This is such a stupid thing as you don\u2019t have any indication of what\u2019s on offer until you sit down. Again, makes planning unnecessarily hard if you\u2019ve got fussy kids and is such a simple thing to put right.", "None of the restaurants offered us a children\u2019s menu either, although we found out half way through our holiday they all do one. Again, it\u2019s just poor customer service that when you dine out with kids, they don\u2019t at least mention there\u2019s a children\u2019s option available, in case there\u2019s nothing on the main menu they fancy.", "Also, be aware that every night at least one of the restaurants seems to be closed. Again, there is no mention of this anywhere, so it can be pot luck if the one you decide to go to is open or not and puts more pressure on the ones that are open to accommodate all the diners. No one ever explained this to us or told us which ones were closed on which nights.", "The service in the restaurants, much like the resort in general, is very hit and miss. We had a very rude waiter not even welcome us or introduce himself at Trattoria one night; his customer service consisted of pointing at each of us in turn and simply saying \u201cwhat do you want\u201d. Despite this we re-visited the same restaurant later in our holiday and in fact got spoken to and treated even worse by someone else, which actually resorted in us walking out before our food arrived. I have never ever done this in my life before.", "We had bad experiences and nasty food (cold, overcooked, delayed) in Portofino (supposedly one of the more upmarket establishments) both times we went there and another time in the Seaside Grill. We found Oceana and the Japanese restaurant (it\u2019s more like a Chinese to us Brits) were consistently the best for food and service, but even our favourite Oceana was soured on our penultimate night, as we all ordered our favourite dishes, only for totally different versions to arrive. I told the waiter there\u2019s a mistake and this is not what we ordered, but he just laughed and said \u201cyes it is\u201d. ", "These restaurants are marketed as gourmet, but the food is generally of a very poor quality and often arrived to the table cold. The portions are pretty small too, so don\u2019t be afraid to order more than what you normally would at home. Plenty of people seemed to order 2 main courses each, which is just ridiculous. Just serve a fair portion in the first place!", "Overall, we found the staff around the resort very indifferent in their attitude and how they would treat you. The bar tenders would regularly and blatantly ignore you in favour of faces they recognised or more likely, who tipped them. A couple of times at the pool bars (Barracuda in particular) I had to make a bit of a scene as people would walk up and get served straight away, despite the fact you\u2019d been waiting 5 minutes. I found their demeanour and attitude just plain rude....they had a snearing arrogance about them. Luckily, the poolside waitresses were excellent, so in the end, we rarely had to physically go to the bar.", "The entertainment team were generally pretty friendly and good for a laugh, as were many of the waiters in the World Cafe. There were also a few individuals who always stood out for just being genuinely nice, friendly people. Quite a few however badly let the resort down and are in need of some serious training considering they\u2019re in the hospitality industry.", "We also wanted to get a late checkout (2pm instead of midday) and actually received an email from the hotel a couple of days before thanking us for staying with them and mentioning late checkouts were possible for a charge of $10 per hour. It went on to tell you to visit reception and organise. Perfect, happy with all that, until we went to reception and they told us you can\u2019t in fact do this until the final day of your stay. How ridiculous is that? It meant we went into our final day not knowing whether we had the morning to relax and enjoy by the pool or not. When I went up to reception at 8.00am on our final morning to confirm if the late checkout would be possible, I got told their systems were down so they still couldn\u2019t confirm and to come back an hour or so later! What an unbelievably poor final impression to leave on your guests, which all could have been so easily avoided.", "Our overall impressions of Dreams Punta Cana was that it was ok. It wasn\u2019t dreadful, but it certainly wasn\u2019t wonderful.  Maybe you have to pay extra for \u201cPreferred\u201d status to be treated differently here, but why the hell should that be the case? Also, why they call it \u201cPreferred\u201d I\u2019ll never know as it just gives the regular guests the impression you\u2019re not as good as this other lot. We personally expect a lot more from our holidays, so although we got some sun and had a nice break from our regular routines, all the extras that make a holiday special were lacking, which was a real shame."]},

The personnel was really nice and helpful, except for the concierge who was really pushy to get us into travel smart. The resort was generally very clean, so was the Room. I found the bed particularly comfortable, and the Room quiet (we were far from the pool though), but the room needed somme refresh (for instance, one of the bed table was broken, and the door of the toilet was missing some screws and not closing properly). The Food was good. Good note for the morning and lunch buffets, who were always fresh, with variety everyday. The \u00e0 la carte restaurants were not bad, but nothing out of this world. We did really enjoy the fresh cheviche, which we end up having several time during our stay. One particular thing that really bugged us was the lack of shade spot around the pool and beach areas... forget to have a spot if you did not get up to reserve your spot before 7am! On the last day, I ran out of water while taking my shower, having to complete my rinsing using water bottles. Alter the water came back, my boyfriend took a shower and the same thing happened to him as well. On the bright side, the fitness team, with Fabio, Jay Carlos and Ivonne, was amazing!

We never had a bad meal and there is plenty of variety. Buffet for breakfast and different restaurants each night. Burgers pool side and other meals during the day ensure you never go hungry. Again, all food was wonderful, presented with style and tasted great. Francisco Garrido at Hunter treated us as family and took great care of us. He enjoys his job and it shows! Thank you Francisco!Alexander Nunez the hostess at Hunter was so pleasant and always happy to see us. A very pleasant lady. Livio Samboy at the Diamond Club beach bar prepared us snacks and authentic Dominican food to try. It was outstanding and his skills are phenomenal. In dinning having him provide samples of the local food was worth the price of Diamond Club alone. Ruth the hostess at Tanjine, Julio our server, at the breakfast buffet and Tanjine, were spectacular, friendly and always willing to assist us. Santo at Vespa was a great server. Nathaly the bar tender by Tanjine was perfect and makes a great martini! The entertainment was great daily and the Vibe team are great entertainers. Daily activities were always fun and exciting. Nightly entertainment was good but as we are mid-age found some of the music lyrics questionable. But they have to cater to a wide range of people not just us.", "Staff- we were greeted as most everyone, made to feel welcome and did a thorough job of getting us checked in and welcomed. Victor, Libanesa, Isai, Mario are excellent choices for the first impression of guests. Victor solved a problem we encountered, (more on this below), with professionalism and courtesy we no longer see at home. He went above and beyond to take care of us. The bar staff were so pleasant and attentive to our requests. There are so many to thank and we made wonderful friends. Johan Collado become our son! That kid is the best! He took such personal care of us and was just fabulous. Keep him around, he made our trip! We love that kid! Leonel, Richard, Diahana, at the Diamond Club bar became family to us. Those people know how to take care of the guests, serve great drinks and pay special attention to make sure they took care of us. They work their tails off and we noticed treat everyone with courtesy. Marisol was our waitress pool side and was so pleasant, she is very friendly and attentive to making sure guests are taken care of. Ronald our Butler was great! Took care of us and made sure we had anything and everything we needed. He was always professional and responsive to our requests. The one who deserves a lot of recognition is Gilda our housekeeper! Talk about service! That lady was by far the best housekeeper we have ever seen. She is so friendly, does such a thorough job and always provided a special touch such as the flowers on our bed, our last day spelling out Happy Trip. What a wonderful person. Mario in security took care of us and kept an eye out for us one evening when we were the last folks on the beach. Thank you. I will say as advice, beware of those who are opportunist\u2019s. I told one of the guys who was on duty at the entrance to our room area there was no way I was going to do the Time Share pitch and his level of service and friendliness stopped. He told me the cigars he got us were $7 and told the wife they were $5. A former resident of New York who I found to be a bit shady. As they say, buyer beware, when dealing with some of the folks. Angela and Black Panther of the vibe team provided great entertainment with dance moves like none seen! The staff took great pride in assisting us. Thank you! Prior to our return next year, it will be based on if those mentioned above are still working there. We give the staff a 100 % for effort and success.", "Resort- okay... its a year round resort, we get that. One issue we had upon arrival and going into the room after everyone took care of us, we noticed the ceiling above the tub was damaged and leaking water. We notified Victor, (see above), he took care of us, comped us a cabana and apologized. I get these things happen. The wife noticed the curtain rods were not attached, missing hooks on the curtains and the slider door was difficult to operate. I think during the past renovation, the practicality of some things were overlooked to make things look \u201cChic\u201d. The reason we gave them a 4 star versus 5 is for the upkeep on the room. It\u2019s hard to rate it a 5 star with the discrepancies mentioned. Again, we get the rooms are probably booked so often there is no time to keep up. However, it\u2019s those touches that make 5 stars. Nothing really presented us from having a good time or harmed us, it\u2019s just when you pay the money you do for a top rated resort, you expect top rate, not curtain rods tied to curtains with plastic strips. ", "For us, we enjoy the beach. The beach to us seems calmer than we found last year at EPC. We would not make that our total choice to return but we do enjoy being able to do some ocean swimming. The staff cleans the beach every morning as the seaweed is present but that\u2019s not the resorts fault. They do keep it clean. The gym is adequate! A bit small with not all items we were used to at home. However, with a bit of adjustment you can make it work. ", "Overall we had a great time and can\u2019t emphasize enough how well those mentioned took care of us! A great trip and time. As mentioned, if we recognize those here currently are still here next year, that will help us decide to return. The management could do a better job in our opinion of a maintenance and repair program. We know that doesn\u2019t make them instant money, but in the long run it\u2019s the difference between 3,4, or 5 star resorts. "]},

{"hotel": ["Dreams Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Overpriced"], "content": ["I still cannot believe how awful this experience was at this resort. When we arrived, they hadn't had power all day. After over 12 hours of travel, being famished and not being able to get food outside of a burger or hotdogs was so unappealing. The food was pretty bad at every restaurant.  Overcooked food with 10lbs of salt is their motto. Vegetables were really hard to come by as the few they had were drenched in butter. The cafe had the most variety, but never consistent. The mexican grill was the best option, but was never open and they refused and I mean refused to give you guacamole, even when they would tell you it would be out the next day. Gourmet meals is how they describe their food, but this was bottom of the barrel only offering the cheapest foods. The world cafe cooks were for the most part extremely rude and seemed like they did not want to be there. We tipped the ones that would actually provide a good customer experience. I'm a big cruiser and the food there on the biggest ships in the world are decent, in comparison to food at this resort made the cruise food seem Michelin quality. I still can't believe I spent thousands of dollars for such a mediocre experience. All the night activities were very cheesy outside of the magician. The night club had very few customers 6 of the 7 nights. The one night it was really busy, but it was stifling with no air and high humidity. I can tell you I'm not big into Mexico, but I'll be doing an all inclusive next time in Mexico instead or just stick to cruising. Lastly, the 30 plus ppl in our group all complained about the \"included\" alcohol. It was extremely watered down and very low end. Which is why those that were already at the resort were asking for ppl coming in to stop at the duty free for \"real\" alcohol lol. If you are a captain Morgan drinker, you will want to bring your own as they didn't have it even in the \"Preferred\" club. The weather was beautiful and the beach was nice.

Did not have any doubles available until day before we were leaving.  One of our rooms smelled like mildew and shower leaked into room.  No bathroom door but rather a glass shower door and half glass toilet room door.  Little awkward especially if sharing a room with a friend.  Turned off by the up selling by butlers to get you to listen to their time share seminar.  Bathrooms all over the property had issues with toilets flushing or hand dryers not working. Buffet was good but experiences in the different restaurants were hit or miss.  Food often just luke warm and wine was horrible.  Suggest purchasing a better bottle of wine than the house wine included.  Skip the sushi restaurant as it was not good at all.  If you are a beer drinker there is only one beer available at the bars.  Wish there would have been a drink menu.  Lots of people drinking interesting looking drinks but no idea what is in any of them or how to order one (don\u2019t know the names). Did not like that they allowed local sellers in the lobby and by pools on certain days.  Super high pressure people in your face trying to get you to buy their overpriced crap!

{"hotel": ["Grand Palladium Bavaro Suites Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Allergy Friendly"], "content": ["The main reason that our family chose the Grand Palladium group is because they are the only all-inclusive we could find that has a food allergy \"system\" with a protocol in place. My son has life-threatening allergies to dairy, nuts, sesame, sunflower seeds, and fish and we usually rent a home and cook for ourselves when we travel. However, we decided to go for it, and brought 6 Epi-pens - never used, thankfully! So, the 5 stars are for the staff who did a great job of feeding Sam all week. My recommendation is to find a manager at each restaurant that you will deal with each day, and stick to those restaurants to minimize risk. The managers speak English, and usually other languages, pretty well. At the breakfast and lunch buffets we asked that food be prepared separately in the kitchen for Sam, which they accommodated, although it could take a while. We had  great help from a staff member named Alan, who would pre-prepare Sam's breakfast every day (eggs, bacon, pancakes, and a huge plate of fruit) so that we did not have to wait. Alan also helped us at the a la carte dinner, La Paisana, which had excellent steak, and french fries that were safe - a true treat. We only had dinner at a la carte restaurants - Lola (the Osso Bucco was good for Sam), and El Dorado (steakhouse). There were many other staff who were especially helpful, Luis, Andre, and particularly the hostesses at all restaurants who treated us like special guests because of the allergies. We stuck to the same lunch request at one of the lunch buffets, because it felt busy and crowded (spring break!), but that was fine (chicken breast seared in vegetable oil, with steamed potatoes and carrots, and a plate of fruit).        While the hotel issues you a piece of paper with certain allergy groups circled on it, to take around to the restaurants, we also brought our own write up, in very simple Spanish and large print, to show at each restaurant. Our note included the severity of the allergies (possible death!), the specific foods (including sesame seeds, sunflower, etc. which is a level of detail not included on the hotel paper), and also, VERY HELPFUL, a list of foods Sam CAN EAT safely, including olive & vegetable oil, all meats, fruits, vegetables, grains, etc. The staff seemed to appreciate the additional letter, and I brought a couple of copies, bringing it with us everywhere. It is ALWAYS stressful to dine out for us, so I'm not going to say it wasn't stressful, especially with varying levels of communication/language. But we made it though 17 meals without even the hint of an allergic reaction, and for that, 5 stars.", "Where we struggled a little was with our teenagers (15 and 17) who expected to meet teenaged community at the \"teen club.\" We were there at the busiest time of year and the teen club was empty the whole time. We think that the issue is that the hotel \"accidentally\" issues 18-and-older bracelets to pretty much any teen over 14 who could pass for 18. This gets the teens into the disco (and bars), as well as into other adult-only places - like the gym - so why would they go to the teen club???? We STUPIDLY pointed out the mistake for our son (15) and got him the kid bracelet. Then we spent a great deal of time and energy getting an exception made for him to go the gym (his main interest), and even then they would only let him in between 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. WITH a parent, which was truly not where we wanted to be at that time, and it messed up the daily schedule, and made lunch timing tricky. The hotel would not switch out his bracelet, despite the obvious \"mistakes\" everywhere (including our own 17 year old daughter, and a pair of 14-year old twins we met!). We did not want to send out daughter to the disco alone, and finally resorted to cutting off and switching out our bracelets with our son, having to creatively reattach them the next day. Why not just make the disco all-ages, and only serve alcohol to people with adult wrist bands?? Why not let a teen into the gym with a parent at any time??? When we arrived, the hotel did not give us the schedule of activities each day, so it was difficult for us to know what fun events were going on around the gigantic resort. We figured this out around our 3rd day out of 5, which also frustrated our teens who missed foam parties and other events where they could have found other teens looking for companions. ", "We also did not like being constantly peddled excursions, jewelry, and \"travel club\" membership both at the resort and on the resort's beach. But that seems to be unavoidable, wherever you go in DR, from what we hear.", "Otherwise, the rooms were very well appointed, spacious, and clean. The cleaning staff was excellent. The pools and the beach were beautiful. And the resort, over all, was quite good. The bar, Hemmingway's served the best cocktails, by far. The steaks at all a la carte restaurants were excellent, and they would serve you another if you wanted it! The food was so reliable, that my son ate the steak tar tar - raw beef - pretty impressive, and I had fresh mussels at the buffet - no problems! The outdoor sports center was also excellent, where my son found a pick-up soccer game every night before dinner, and where we also enjoyed family ping pong in the late afternoon. They also have beautiful tennis, paddleball, beach volleyball, badminton, and mini-golf."]},

{"hotel": ["Dreams Punta Cana Resort & Spa"], "title": ["Great family vacation"], "content": ["I read a lot of reviews on this site before picking this resort, so I feel like I should do my part and give back to the dialogue.  We went for 6 days as a family with a 10 and 5 year old, plus grandparents, and friends with a baby.  We had a wonderful time, and the only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars for me is the food, which was only okay.", "- Room - we had a family suite, which is two connected rooms.  It was perfect for the four of us.  The girls had plenty of space, and we could close the doors when we wanted privacy.  Our room was cleaned at least once a day, and occasionally they came and did a turn down service.  They also decorated the door and the room for my birthday.  We were only there in the evening/night, so I don't know when they cleaned it, but it was always clean by the time we showed up a little after 5.  The beds were very comfortable, and we slept well.", "- Pool - The pool is AMAZING.  It's huge and you can find the section that best meets your needs.  If you want the party/activity zone, camp out near the swim up bar.  There's always fun music and something going on.  If you want it a bit calmer move a bit farther up.  Our favorite spot was up near the flamingo pond.  We were within easy walking distance of the bathrooms, bar, and the grill station.  We also loved the floating mats.  The poolside drink service was also nice.  Sometimes it took awhile for the drinks to show up, but with the bar close by, we could just walk over and get a drink ourselves if we were impatient.  We usually showed up around 9 and found seats easily.  Seats did fill up as the day went on, but there were always a couple if you just wanted to drop your stuff off before jumping in.", "- Beach - There were some days with a lot of seaweed, but we just waded through it and into the ocean.  There were plenty of comfy seats all day long, and you could choose shade or sun.  We usually migrated to the beach in the afternoon and had no trouble finding a seat.  We also had preferred club for the special beach beds.  I didn't feel like getting up at the crack of dawn to claim a bed, but most afternoons one became available and we could hang out there.  The staff in that area were all fantastic, and they definitely enforced the time limits on the beds, so people couldn't claim one all day without sitting at it.", "- Restaurants - This was honestly our biggest disappointment.  Luckily, we had the preferred option of eating at Oceana, which was great, but it's the only restaurant that's open for a sit down lunch.  Otherwise the restaurants are only open for dinner, and every night at least one was closed for a special event.  We were especially disappointed with Portofino, which we finally got into on our last night only to discover that they used no salt in their cooking.  The pasta was completely tasteless.  Overall the resort food was just okay.  There wasn't anything we sent back, but there wasn't anything that was so good that anyone was like, oh my gosh you have to try this.  For fast food, the burgers were not very good, but we enjoyed the hot dogs.  The pizza was okay.  The kids menu is the same in every restaurant.  Luckily, our 5 year old is fine with having the same dinner options every night. ", "Explorers' Club - Our girls LOVED the Explorers Club, and they spent a large part of their day there.  The programming was varied enough to hold their attention, and they took the kids to the World Cafe for lunch which my girls really enjoyed.  You just have to be prepared with something dry to put on over their bathing suits since they do both water and non-water activities, and they have to have dry clothes for World Cafe.  We have girls, so we generally dropped them off in their bathing suits with a t-shirt and shorts to put over it for lunch. You also have to reapply sunscreen yourself, so we stopped by in the afternoon for a sunscreen refresh.  They have a good mix of indoor and outdoor activities, plus a fun movie in the evenings, so the girls weren't in the sun all the time, which was great.  My 10 year old was a bit disappointed that they didn't have better \"tween\" programming, but she made a friend, which made all the difference.  If you have slightly older kids, you might want to make sure they have a buddy.", "Spa - My 10 year old and I had a \"spa date\".  The facilities are lovely, and we had a lot of fun trying out some of the sauna and hydrotherapy options.  They put us in a \"couples\" room for our massages without me having to ask, so that I wouldn't be worried about her.  I got a hot stone massage and it was excellent.  She enjoyed her aromatherapy massage.", "Service - Overall everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.  We speak Spanish, but most of the staff spoke good English.  A little Spanish goes a long way though, so knowing a few basic words and phrases will always be appreciated.  The main area of improvement we noted though was that there needs to be significantly MORE staff.  The people who were there were working their tails off, especially behind the bar where there was usually just one person.  All the bars should be staffed with at least two people at all times.  The service often felt strained in the restaurants too, especially at breakfast in Oceana.  Some days our breakfast came right away, and at least twice we waited over 20 minutes.  There's a cook station in the restaurant, so it doesn't seem like should take that long to whip up some eggs.  I like eggs benedict, and half the time the yolk was cooked completely solid.  We suggest that they move some of the staff who are in the lobby trying to upsell you stuff and put more on the grounds.  We tried to be nice and listen to the talk one of the guys wanted to give us.  We gave him 30 minutes, but when he handed us off to another woman who said we had to listen to a 90 minute talk we said no thank you and walked.  I honestly don't understand how they think this is a viable sales model, and apparently since we didn't listen to the 90 minute talk, the nice guy we started with doesn't get paid as much.  Not okay.", "Overall verdict: The property is beautiful, and we had a wonderful time.  I don't know if we would go back.  I might try to find something with better food options, but I would certainly consider going there again.  We are used to 5 star resorts in Asia, and this is certainly not that, but it's a lovely place."]},

We stayed in building 7 and it was centrally located between the lobby and the beach.  Yes, the rooms are a little outdated, but we didn\u2019t care.  We didn\u2019t come to stay in the room all day.  The bed was comfortable and you can even request what type of pillow you would like.  I feel like there were 3 or 4 choices.

There was a club house down by the restaurants/beach that you can go into and cool off in the air conditioning, get a top shelf drink, get some finger foods, use the restrooms or just relax and watch some tv.  There was someone always in there that you could talk to if you needed anything.  The pool chairs did fill up in the morning but we were always able to find a spot either by the pool or on the beach.  Franklin who is a butler, was working on the beach, and he was fabulous.  He would always find us one of the beds on the beach or if one wasn\u2019t available, he would come and let us know when one opened up. They were always cleaning up the seaweed on the beach.  That wasn\u2019t a problem.  Staff was fantastic! So friendly and always asking how things were.  The grounds are immaculate.  So beautiful and tropical.   Loved the flamingos walking around by the pool.  The food was good!   If you can\u2019t find something you like then you must be a picky eater!! Never had to wait except for the Hibachi restaurant, only if you want to sit at the grill table.  We ate at all the restaurants.  They were all good.  Loved the Oceana just because it was closest to the beach and a view of the water.  Oh!!! And they have a fruit stand down by the pool!

It was our first time in DR and we had a blast and can't wait to come back to this resort.  The thing that makes this resort are the employees - they go above and beyond to please their guests.  Please make sure you tip - they deserve it.  We rented a cabana 1 day - and our butler was great in making sure we had drinks and food and the bartender at the swim-up bar was great.  It rained for a little bit during the day we had the cabana but it was awesome swimming in the rain, would not trade it for anything.", "We went on a tour of Don Lucas Cigar factory and it was a nice short getaway and I was able to do some souvenir shopping.

Second time travelling to Punta Cana, first time at a Royalton property.  Chic is a great size resort (we like smaller resorts), everything is close from pool to beach to restaurants.  A lot of activity on site if you're interested.  We are more on the relaxed/quiet side, and found the beach to be quiet along with the mermaid pool and even the smaller pool near the buffet was quiet until later afternoon.  Travelled as TravelSmart members under my parents membership.  The perks of being TravelSmart/Diamond Club were definitely worth it for us with the private beach area (w/ restaurant), mermaid pool access, restaurant reservations, etc.  Upon arrival we immediately got checked in and had a private tour of the facility by Luis w/ TravelSmart.  We were not 100% satisfied with our original assigned room, and so they moved us right away.  Throughout the rest of our stay Ruben with TravelSmart was excellent.  He checked in with us daily, made all our reservations and provided any assistance we needed.  In addition to the TravelSmart service, we found all the resort staff to be very friendly, those working at the buffet and the guy working at the mermaid pool, I think his name was Jomar, were above expectation. Overall we had a great vacation, will definitely return someday!"]},

Housekeeping was a bit disappointing and inconsistent. Some days we had garbage bags some days not. Some days they refreshed our face cloths, some days not. I actually had to call for face cloths. They only leave 2 large bottles of water in the room, if we wanted more we had to be around when the minibar stock came, as our notes (and tip)  did not get us what we asked for. The mini bar only comes stocked with 4 beers (2 Budweiser 2 Presedente), 4 bottles of pop (coke, Coke Zero, Fanta and sprite)and a pack of peanuts.

Everyone seems genuinely interested in making this a great vacation. During check-in they of course offer upgrades, some sound good but aren\u2019t all they are cracked up to be. For one they offer butler service for 35 dollars a day and private cabanas on the beach with waiter and stocked cooler with water, beer and sodas. They also include a premium bottle of liquor for 200. We received a special for 200 which included butler service and private cabana. What they don\u2019t tell you is only four people in the cabana or you get charged 35 a person extra and we never received our liquor. Which was never communicated upfront as we are here for a wedding with about 20 people. Also our butler Ugery is fantastic, but... he is only allowed to make reservations for the party who pays, that\u2019s fine but needs to be communicated. We also received a notification upon arrival that there would be no power or running water from 11am to 5pm. That sucks! It\u2019s hot, and with a UV index of 12 you can only be outside for so long. Power finally came back on but went back out at 1230am again super HOT! Power has gone on and off four times in our six days. You will be bombarded with beach vendors trying to sell you stuff even in the private cabana. Everyone is constantly trying to sell you something at the resort cigars, massages, trips and dinners on the beach. It\u2019s fine the first time but gets old by day two. The beach is not the best with tons of sea weed and only a small useable section for swimming. The food is mediocre at best, very small portions. I\u2019m totally fine with small portions in hot weather but the food should be outstanding. My NY Strip streak at the restaurant was about 1/8 of an in thick with about 4 steak fries. Breakfast and lunch is also below average. As for the accommodations. The rooms are comparable to that of an aging Motel6. Bed is ok, pillows are very small and thin. At check out, they again tried to charge us for the additional people in the cabana. We had a manager look at the sign and the agreement we signed, 4 people was not present on either form. The form states \u201cthe agreed number of people?? Ok! What\u2019s that number. Needless to say we did not pay for the extra people and we still did not get the \u201cpremium liquor\u201d. If the staff listened to the customer a little more instead of constantly trying to sell you stuff these things would not happen. All in all our trip was ok, but I would probably look for a more up to date experience. And yes there are mosquitoes!"]},

This causes issue with the wood being bubbled and peeling. We had to ask several times for water and for the frig to be restocked. They would take the towels and wash clothes and just bring back towels. Had to ask several times for the was clothes before we got them. Things that should just be replaced had to be asked for several times. Our electricity went out the first day, but was fixed pretty fast. We went to dinner as not to be in the dark. Probably my biggest complaint, I understand the reasoning but still MY complaint, is the lack of alcohol in the drinks. I had cosmos the first night there, 2 with their vodka and one with mine.  The first 2 nothing but the cranberry juices. The last one I asked for Titos vodka and THAT was the drink I was use to. We asked for topical drinks all week long and the alcohol is so watered down you really don't any.  There is 0 taste and 0 affects of the drinks we ordered. They would put a lot of liquid in the bottom of the drink out of an alcohol bottle but, nah, not alcohol. The only time we had the relaxation of alcohol was when we bought out own wine. You have to pay for wine. Oh and buy the way take your coupons with you to buy the wine. They won't take them when you actually pay for everything at the end of the trip.  So I had 3 wine coupons I couldn't use because I tried to use it when I paid before leaving. BTW if you want wine buy it first thing when you get there, they run out quickly and you won't be able to get the same wine at dinner.   Another big issue, they will want you to sit down for 1 1/2 hour sales pitch. Was not told this at all before I booked. We just told them we would be wasting every ones time if we sat thru it. There is always someone walking around trying to sign you up for spas, adventures, or try to get you to buy trinkets. We bought some but they were trying to pull you in every direction to buy.  All cost money. So be ready to pay for anything you really want to do.  I over heard someone say they tipped their serve and got actual alcohol. The all inclusive is great if you just like to eat and spend time in the sun. If you like drinks and to do things other than that you have to pay for it yourself.  This was to be my daughters 30 birthday celebration but there was no drinking to celebrate unless we bought the wine. We did and had one good night of fun.  It's a lovely place just needs to work out some kinks. Honestly though, for the money I spent I could of had a wonderful Airbnb home with great food and drink all week. I don't think I'll be doing another all inclusive."]},

The vacation was great, the only reason for the 4 star and not the 5 star was because upon arrival we did not have the room that we originally booked. However, I have to say we were graciously helped by Luisa Guest Service Manager. She immediately took control of the situation and placed us in a temporary room for one night that did not have the room with the Jacuzzi we originally booked but to compensate she went out of her way to make sure to plan a  beautiful dinner for us all 4 nights. The next day we were placed in a room with a Jacuzzi and given a bottle of champagne because it was our anniversary. Honestly if it wasn't for Luisa stepping in I believe we would not have been as well taken care of as we were. She is exceptional, professional and very sweet. She heard all our concerns and put in her best effort to assure us that we would enjoy our stay at Chic. The resort is beautiful, clean and i loved the fact that it was an adults only resort. It is a fun laid back place to stay and I think we would definitively recommend staying there again."]},

I currently belong to a vacation club at another resort and went to the Hard Rock on a trial vacation.  This resort is very large but we were able to check off all of our boxes as excellent!  Service, Food, Drinks, Beach, Pool and Entertainment were all excellent.  The staff were always welcoming and accomondating.  There is alot going on througout the resort but all staff members are on the same page with wanting to provide the best experience to all of thier guests.  The restaraunts are wonderful with a good selection of food.  I have 2 small complaints 1)would be the ambience of the Brazillian Steak House the night we were there.  The room was dark, but there was on waiter that was serving that kept yelling out \"Yeah Baby\" as he served food to patrons.  You could here him throughout the restaraunt and it felt as if I was in a high school gym. 2) would be the resort credit store that were selling T shirts at $40 & $50 dollars that would sell anywhere else for $10-$15.", "We enjoyed a couples massage and it was fantastic!

Transportation from airport was quick! We were at the resort before we knew it.  Check in was a but sluggish but we were checked into building 4A, which was near the main lobby.  Room was big spacious and clean, loved the huge balcony.  Barbara was our hotel rep for our stay and she was amazing she booked our dinner reservations and answered all our questions.  Gracias Barbara por todo!  The resort is large but not by any means un-walkable, there were trams all over but we chose to walk the resort and never had any issues. We had dinner at Ipanema almost every night (which is like copa cabana here in Canada) I honestly don't know how anyone could complain about the food here, they had an enormous selection for all tastes.  Food was fresh and service was amazing.  We also had dinner at ZEN the tappenyaki restaurant where they cook in front of you (you have to do this!) the Lebanese restaurant Bistro Med was really good! We tried the Market for lunch was your typical buffet with lots of selection to choose from.   We had breakfast everywhere but learned that it's the same at every restaurant so if you want a view with breakfast eat at ISLA and TORO if you don't care about the view, CIAO is lovely.  We had room service a few times, very limited menu but still great food.  ISLA we had dinner once this is the seafood restaurant, it was ok, fresh and tasty but we preferred the selection at IPANEMA.  We never once had an issue finding pool loungers or towels, the service from the ladies was incredible, they would remember where we like to sit, our drinks everything! Our room was always clean by the time we got back before dinner after lounging at the pool or beach.  The beach is incredible! Huge beach with snow white sand and tons of loungers and bars.  The flags were yellow the whole week and we still enjoyed the beach daily. Its gorgeous!  There is an ice cream shop that you can get fresh made smoothies and frappes called ICE CONE, you must try this! My son and i enjoyed this place every day!  We had lunch at La Pizzetta it was soooo good! There's also a cafe in the lobby called MUST, you can get coffee, frozen cappuccino, desserts and sandwiches, also amazing.  There was entertainment each day of the week, including shows and various entertainers in the lobby area, really enjoyed the violinist!  We saw Michael Jackson and Batman.  Our son didn't use Kids Club but it was available.  The lobby is like a shopping mall with stores like Hard Rock, Pandora, Tourism Shops, Liquor Store, Chocolate Shop etc.  Basically we travel with an open mind, we had minor inconveniences in the room like our faucets leaked did it ruin our stay? NO! The service here is something incredible! With such a large place we were still made to feel like family.  We did not encounter any dogs on the beach for those that are worried, no mosquito bites, no one in the family had stomach issues.  My husband golfed 4x while here so safe to say he enjoyed it.

The room was nice the TV was large. The bathroom was compact as my companion and I were often dodging each other for use of the sink and toilet. They supply water bottles and toiletries. The shower has a large rainfall head and a handheld. At the end of the shower there is a window. The pink lights can be shutoff but at night, many of the rooms have the pink lights on. There are 4 lower shelf liquor bottles which we did not use. The fridge was stocked with pepsi, 7up, Coors, Heineken, and water. Don't order the champagne; it's terrible. The is 24 hour room service but we never ordered anything.", "We could only eat at the buffet for breakfast and lunch. We picked what we liked and just ate that consistently as the buffet  options don't change much. We ate at 3 of the specialty dining  restaurants without reservations and we only needed to wait for seating at the steakhouse. We liked Vespa the best. Try the tiramisu. There was nightly entertainment, but many of the shows use strobe/flashing lights and my companion is sensitive. He enjoyed the Queen tribute the best. The pool closes at 7PM so the stage near the pool is used for shows. There is entertainment at the pool with music and games. They over serve alcohol so it can rowdy. We observed women visibly falling down and walking into glass doors. The beach was nice, there are vendors but they approach nicely. There is one waitress on the beach and she can get distracted at the bar but gets upset when you get your own drink. We also visited the spa. The only hot jacuzzi is at the spa but the jets weren't working, neither was the sauna in mens room or the steam room on the womens side. The massage was terrible and I think it lasted 10 minutes when we paid for 25 min ($85). We were graciously harrassed by employees stationed outside our building labeled as concierge. They followed us around insisting on the timeshare(vacation ownership) tour.  90 minutes was 3.5 hours and we didn't eat. Let us save you the trouble. You pay them a lump sum of $10000 (low end) and $300 and year and then you still pay when you come to visit but you only pay half the price."]},

There was a bit of dampness, but that's to be expected in a warmer climate, and I don't think it was horrible.", "Our butler was Jesus.  At least I think that was his name as we hardly ever saw him.  The reason we did diamond club was because we had a large group and we wanted to have reservations for dinner every night.  Well he said we could only get 6 or 9 pm because of the size of our group.  Or we could do two tables instead of one big one.  Not sure how that made a difference.  So we said fine.  Well, the first night he didn't even make our reservation (he said he did and the restaurant screwed up), the 2nd night the tables were on opposite sides of the restaurant.  The 3rd night was the birthday and we had a special dinner in a cabana so that was nice.  The next night again we didn't have reservations that he said he made.  We gave up after that and just went ourselves to the restaurant and would have to wait.  Although I don't think it was ever more than 30 minutes.  We had also asked Jesus to decorate our pool cabana for the birthday.  Even brought our own supplies.  Saw him in the morning and reminded him.  Finally at about noon we had to track him down and tell him again.  Said it was supposed to be done by 10 am.  He finally did it.", "Restaurants were decent.  Buffet had a ton of options.  We only had breakfast and lunch there.  So not sure what the dinners were like.  We tried all of the a la cart restaurants as well.

Jimmy replaced him one of the days and he was great as well.  I didn't think the music from the next pool (where the entertainment was) was blaring.

Remember there is no reservations - first come first served. Would recommend to go early for the Habachi since they sit only 11 at each grill. Larger parties can sit for a Chinese menu. Elizabeth and Melissa at the main buffet were very sweet. Enjoyed the omelet station fresh fruit and salad bar. The coffee bar was a big hit fresh coffee deserts and small sandwiches. Positive note is that if one of us was not thrilled with our meal there was always the buffet and room service.", "Ok, here is my only real complaint but it was at the start of our vacation and it was almost a deal breaker but management got involved and remedied the situation. But just a heads up. So we get to the hotel at 5 30 since our flight was delayed - we shedualed Super Shuttle thankfully and they took us directly to hotel. Upon checking in the attendant, Joel stated that our room was not ready. Not ready? Check in is at 3- not happy. So I ask if we could be upgraded to another room since after all the Hotel is not fulfilling my reservation. Joel says well if you would like a larger room,for an additional $300 they are having a \u201cspecial\u201d today. I am exhausted so I reluctantly agree. In previous experiences- Iberostar, Rui, Bavario - either the rooms were ready or we were compensated by having a upgrade or  so not to wait. Well from there another staff member takes us on what i thought was going on be a tour of the grounds. He starts pitching us some time sharing concept. Thoroughly annoyed we go to our \u201cupgraded\u201d room which was on the third floor  no elevator room not ready & view is service road with an empty overgrown lot with a very unslightly view. Thoroughly annoyed and loudly stated my complaint in the lobby seriously was ready to leave Gerald reassured me & room  on 2nd fl facing the pool/ garden was sufficient.

The furniture could use an upgrade even though the hotel is relatively new.  (4 years).

I honestly wish they taught classes here in Toronto.  I loved the aqua spinning class, if you see them setting up, don\u2019t be shy, try it.  You spin in the water.

Most of the time no one is swimming and I never saw any water activities going on at any point in 7 days. Water was pretty rough. They do have other activities by the pool just nothing much goes on at the beach. Water is also not turquoise although I knew that before I came.

No communication WHATSOEVER about delay. ", "6) TORRENTIAL RAIN 6 OUT OF 7 DAYS", "I don't know that this can be blamed on the resort, but the weather channels all said Punta Cana was sunny every day while this resort had torrential rain EVERY DAY except the last. Chic is not in Punta Cana, it is about 30 mins outside, on the most elevated point of the island (apparently) so perhaps elevation had something to do with more rain, or it was just bad luck.

The staff of the hotel was friendly beyond belief from the groundskeepers to the shuttle drivers to the restaurant staff, bartenders and concierges (our concierge, Angie, was always cheerful, thoughtful and able to help us negotiate every detail of our stay.)  In addition, they use a tractor to clear off the seaweed from the beach each day as well as having a protective boom cordoning off their beach area so we were able to enjoy the beach and swim in the ocean every day with no problems, despite a number of the beaches to the north of us (side away from airport) having some serious seaweed problems.  I think the drinks were a bit weak (which might be a good thing considering they are unlimited) as I never woke up with a hangover which normally happens if I drink.  They also had great entertainment every night and the lobby was gorgeous and a fantastic place to hang out at after dinner.  All in all we just had the most wonderful time and I highly, highly recommend this resort."]},

We did have a request before we arrived to have extra water delivered to the rooms for one in our party due to a medical issue, but it was only delivered once after another member of our party had to use his \"work voice\" with the staff; the rest of the time we had to get it ourselves from the Diamond Club lounge.  On the other hand, for the one in our group with a food allergy, the staff did an amazing job of making sure to point out entrees that had the ingredients and then confirm with the chef after we placed our order to make sure her entrees did not contain anything she was allergic to.", "The Elements buffet, although smaller than other properties, had the highest quality of food so far.  Two of my favorites where the very tender steak, and their pizza/calzones.   The salads looked good, but let's face it I'm not eating salad on vacation.   We also ate at Munchies while at the pools and enjoyed their burger, nachos, and cheese sticks (we ordered a hotdog once but never got it).  We also order food from the Diamond Club beach area one day and they gave the food from one of our couples to someone else and when we reordered they didn't not make it a priority to replace.", "Being a Diamond Club member we also had access to the Diamond Club lounge which we used often for making top shelf drinks and getting snacks or extra waters.

This was a regular stop for us every day!", "We ate at each of the restaurants  while we were there:", "- Hunters: Both the steak and the salmon was a little over cooked but still very good.  You may consider ordering one step more rare than you want, if needed they can always cook it a little more.", "- Pescari: The sushi was good (it's also available on the buffet and the Diamond Club lounge) as well as the steak and chicken.  I'm sure the ceviche is good if you like it, but it was new for us and we weren't fans.", "- Tagine: Not having had middle eastern cuisine very often, we weren't sure what to expect.  We played it safe with chicken based entrees and were not disappointed.", "- Vespa: Not only the best Italian restaurant at any of the Royalton properties, it really rivals most that we've been to in the states.  We highly recommend the fried mozzarella, the spicy meat pizza (can't remember the name), and both the fettuccini alfredo and the chicken parmesan for entrees.", "One day we rented a cabana as a group (be aware the price only includes 4 people and it's $25/person after that).

We highly recommend that show!", "As I mentioned we are TravelSmart members.  We were  frustrated with somethings that occurred this trip with them.  We were invited to get an update on the program changes, as we have been in the past, but it turned into an hour long upsell attempt (we enjoy our program and use it as much as we currently can based on our availability for travel).  Thankfully, they recognized the value of our time and offered a SmartDollars gift certificate\u2026until we tried to use it to pay for the cabana, which we were told it would cover when it was issued.  Long story short, in order to make it to the airport on time we ended up having to pay for everything out of our pocket.

We chose this resort because we had been to Excellence Punta Cana and that trip was great so why not try another Excellence property and it was a good decision.  We chose the Suite with private plunge pool and the pictures did not do it justice.  I thought it was going to be nice, but it was amazing!  It was a good size pool, with deck, loungers, and chairs!  The room was beautiful as well, like a small one bedroom apartment.  The staff was great, thanks to Emilio, Black Coffee, Dorka, Vanessa, Jonathan, Rosaria (?) our server on the beach, Sam, and the countless others who assisted us in anyway or just said hello as we passed by.  We loved the Michael Jackson show just as we did previously at your other resort.  We attended the white party, the band was great, the only issue we had was seating.  There didn't seem to be enough for the initial rush so our group had to be split up (we did have 10 people though). The Las Vegas show was good and the silent disco party was a whole lot of fun.  We enjoyed the authentic Dominican dinner on the beach and entertainment. Also, had some late nights at the disco :).   We were not able to visit all the restaurants but we enjoyed, The Sports Bar, Oregano (personal fav), The Grill (great steaks), Spice, The Kitchen Table, Las Olas, the Lobster House, the coffee/ice cream shop and who can forget the Shark Food - food truck!!  We participated in only one excursion (this is our 4th time to DR) and it was a repeat party boat with snorkeling for us.  I heard so many people enjoyed the zip lining and dune buggy rides so maybe next time :)  We always do include a spa day and Miile has never disappointed, the hydration station is excellent in itself and the massages are fantastic!

We didn\u2019t receive a greeting or any direction where to go so we kind of followed the crowed to the lineup at the front desk. The Hard Rock had a ransomware attack on their systems which has impacted check-in. It was a bit chaotic and took about 1.5 hrs to check in. We had originally booked a Caribbean Sands room with a king size bed and we were told we had been upgraded to a family suite. While the upgrade was appreciated it was one of those things where we booked the Caribbean sands room as those are closer to the beach \u2013 the upgrade to a bigger room was nice but it was much further back from the beach. So you can look at the \u201cupgrade\u201d from different perspectives. ", "Once we got our room cards once a staff member walked up and said they were our rep and they\u2019d call tomorrow about a time to meet and discuss excursions and any questions we have ( Note: They did call but we never ended up meeting the rep). A Bellboy then met us took our luggage and drove us by golf cart to our room. The Bellboy was great, very personable and gave us useful info and tips about the resort.  ", "Room \u2013 Our room was located in building 7-B and as mentioned we were upgraded to a family suite. The room was massive \u2013 there was a family room with dining table, a kitchenette with sink, fridge and coffee table. Bedroom 1 had 2 double beds and a walk out to the huge balcony. The master suite could be closed with pocket doors. It had a king bed, sitting area, large washroom with double shower and a walk-in closet. It also had a jacuzzi with a walk out to the balcony. The Room was generally clean but the fridge wasn\u2019t stocked so the Bellboy arranged to get that sorted. There was a pull out mini bar in the master suite but 2 of the 4 bottles were empty and there were fruit flies in the bottles. We advised the front desk but they were never changed during our stay.  Otherwise the room was overall clean and everything worked. The maid service throughout the week was good. ", "Resort Grounds \u2013 As many have noted the resort is very big. There is a trolley service that can take you around the resort but realistically you can still walk everywhere. The resort is starting to look a little worn down but still clean overall. There are constantly workers who work very hard at the landscaping and maintenance but it just seems like the property is too big to big to keep up with. ", "Pools \u2013 There are allot of pools on the resort and offer a different vibe for everyone. The main pool is where all the action is with games and music. Other pools have swim up bars and some are more quieter and good for relaxing. There is a kids area with water slides and a small lazy river. There are allot of lounge chairs and umbrellas and areas to get snacks around the pool area. There are also washroom facilities close by which is handy.  ", "Beach \u2013 The beach was very nice and clean. There was always a cabana/hut available and we never really saw people trying to save spots early in the AM. Drink service at the beach was hit and miss. We tipped all the time and the workers were always friendly but most of the time we\u2019d need to walk up to the one of the beach bars for a beverage. There are Bali beds available but evidently they cost $50 per day to rent so not surprisingly the majority of them remained unused. The was a bit of seaweed but nothing too bad and each day tractors came by to clean it up. The waves a bit stronger on the side of the beach with the flags either yellow and red. We enjoyed the waves but some chose to hang by the pool. ", "There are vendors constantly trying to sell you things on the beach. They were polite for the most part but it seemed every couple minutes someone would walk up to your cabana. ", "Restaurants/ Food \u2013 Reservations are required for most restaurants and can only be made the morning of. We chanced it each day and didn\u2019t make reservations and still got in where we wanted too. The food overall was decent to fair but not spectacular. We did enjoy the Italian and Mediterranean places the most. The food at the buffets did get a bit repetitive at times. The pool side snacks were always tasty. We didn\u2019t end up ordering from room service but there was a decent selection.   ", "Entertainment \u2013 Surprisingly I found the entertainment to be a bit disappointing. The nightly shows were OK and they had a few live bands and karaoke but was more or less the same as other resorts in Punta Cana.  I guess my expectations from the \u201cHard Rock\u201d brand were a bit higher. There was a nightclub club located in the Casino, The Casino itself was pretty good with a variety of slot machines, card tables and a bar area with TV\u2019s playing various sports.  However be warned you also have to pay for drinks in the Casino and for the food at the snack bar. I didn't realize this an order drinks and shots only to be presented with a bill.", "Overall Comments \u2013 Some may find this resort very North Americanized which again some may enjoy and other may not. The main lobby area looks more like a strip mall with allot of shops for jewelry, clothes etc. There are additional entertainment options like laser tag an escape room and wine tasting but these all must be paid for. Again being a Hard Rock resort I did expect more from an entertainment perspective especially the nightly shows.  We did enjoy the beach and the availability of cabanas and the different pools were allot of fun depending on your mood. The staff was generally friendly but we didn't find we got the same warmth or level of service compared to other resorts we've visited. There demographic of people went from couples to families with kids and wedding parties so it was great to meet people from different parts of the world. However given the price point and star rating for this resort overall we were a bit underwhelmed. I think for our next trip we'll try something different and maybe smaller."]},

We found ourselves in the Santo Domingo Plaza every evening listening to live Latin music.  The entertainment staff dances with guests which my daughter thoroughly enjoyed.  Edwin the dance choreographer danced with her every night and taught her some dance moves.  He was very professional,  courteous and went out of his was to speak to us whenever he saw us around the resort.  He is a huge asset to the entertainment team.  ", "Food:  The Buffet had lots of variety and we went there a couple times.  We mostly had breakfast at Oceana (for preferred guests only), Lunch at the Seaside Grill and dinners... we tried all but the French restaurant.  All were good, never a long wait and typically had quick service.  Our favorite was Portofino and Himitsu.  If you want to eat at the hibachi table get there when they open so you will not have a long wait, although the wait is worth it.  Look in the Sundial for the restaurant closures.  Casual dress for all except for the French restaurant where men do have to wear pants.", "Spa:  Book your spa treatment with the ladies walking around the pool.  They earn commission on their sales,  The spa is top notch, look  for specials in Sundial (resorts activity flyer).  The spa itself is very clean and the services are hard to beat.  ", "Core Zone: My 12 year old son went here quite often.  Most of the time he went to hang out with other kids that he met while there.  It was school vacation week.  my kids met lots of other teens that they hung out with all week.  They have everything that  a kid could want (including Playstation which I banned my son from playing).", "Professional Pictures:  Adventure Photography is in the lobby.  They do free photo shoots.  You are not obligated to buy any but they do an amazing job and you most likely will want to purchase some. .  We coordinate our clothing ahead of time so we all compliment each other,", "Medical Clinic: sadly I had to use this service.  (I tripped off the sidewalk and fractured my ankle).  The resort staff was very caring and concerned.  They coordinated the Dr visit, taxi ride and had follow up phone calls to me to check in.   I could not have asked more from them they genuinely did care.  Just a heads up... it cost $210 to see the Dr. on staff at the resort, and $120 for a taxi to/from the hospital and the hospital does not take U.S. insurance.   Because of this I would highly recommend medical trip insurance. ", "In closure I highly recommend this resort...It is what you make of it!"]},

It was my first stay at Dreams, but I have been to several other resorts in the Bavaro (Uvero Alto) area.", "Again, I feel it necessary to address some of the other reviews of this resort that have been posted here. I am constantly amazed by the things that people complain about. Setting your expectations before travelling to countries like the Dominican Republic plays such a big part in whether you are going to enjoy your trip. It's a third world country and things are going to happen. If a power outage, broken air conditioner or occasional hot water shortage is going to ruin your vacation, stay home.", "Dreams is an older resort. The room we stayed in was a bit dated but nice and clean. Some of our friends were not so lucky. Their rooms were smaller and a little more in disrepair. The issues were not major and, as I understand it, everything that needed to be resolved was resolved. ", "We stayed in building 9, which is close to the lobby area. It was quiet in the evening and close to the pool, which runs the length of the resort. The walk to the beach takes about two or three minutes at a normal pace. This may seem like a long distance to some but, if you've ever stayed at a Bahia Principe, it definitely isn't.    ", "The pool is long and winds from one end of the resort to the other. There is a swim-up bar at the far end by the beach and a walk-up bar (with swings) about mid-way between the beach and the lobby area. There is plenty of room for everyone and you can choose a quiet spot or one with lots of action. One tiny complaint is that the water level is quite low in places, especially at the swim-up bar where you are basically in water up to your knees (I'm 6'5\") when you order a drink.", "We didn't spend a lot of time at the beach, but it is small and nice. You are confined to swimming in a roped off area of the ocean, but there is plenty of room. The water is warm and crystal clear. There are some waves, but it wasn't really that rough when we were there.", "Personally, I loved the food. I have seen a few people complain about the buffet and it amazes me. We ate breakfast and lunch most days at the buffet and everything was excellent. There is lots of selection and everything is fresh. There is truly something wrong with you if you aren't able to have a meal you enjoy. The wait staff is energetic and attentive. The kitchen staff was good, but not amazing. ", "Most of our dinners were eaten at the a la carte restaurants. We ate twice at the Asian restaurant and enjoyed it both times. The Tepenyaki, despite the long wait, was definitely worth it. The French and Italian restaurants were also very good. The Steakhouse was likely our least favourite. Despite the amazing ambience (it looks like an old Tiki Bar), the service was relatively slow and the food wasn't quite as good as at the other restaurants.", "There is also a cafe in the lower lobby that is open 24/7. It serves specialty coffees, deserts and sandwiches. Everything is nice and fresh. This offers a good food option for between meals.", "My girlfriend and I like to stay active on vacation and make an effort to work out every day. This was easy to do at Dreams because it had a big and spacious gym above the spa. While a bit dated, there was lots of equipment - certainly more than a lot of larger resorts I have been to. In addition to the standard treadmills, elliptical machines and exercise bikes, the Olympic lifting bars and dumbbells up to 55 lbs. were an unexpected treat.", "The bars on the resort are pretty standard. I am a rum drinker and there was an adequate selection. You do have to go to the main lobby bar to get the good stuff.", "One thing that definitely struck me about this resort, and about all-inclusives in general, is how strict and rigid they are with rules and schedules. For example, a group was watching an NHL playoff hockey game at the sports bar. Despite the fact that the game was in overtime, and several people were still watching, the staff shut everything down promptly at 11 pm. No amount of discussion could convince them to deviate from their normal routine. Perhaps this falls in the category of expectations and knowing that things are done differently in other parts of the world.", "Another very serious issue that we came across on the resort was theft. While it did not affect us directly, two members of our group had items stolen from their rooms. One had a ring stolen. The staff performed a perfunctory investigation but ultimately decided that they couldn't do anything about it. Another caught her maid stealing a bridesmaid from her room. The maid pretended not to understand when confronted after the dress was found on her cart wrapped in garbage bags. Again, as far as I know, nothing was done by the resort. The rooms have safes, but be careful about leaving anything valuable out in the open.  ", "Overall, this was a very good vacation. Dreams is not the best resort I have stayed at but the food was great and the accommodations were adequate. The staff was pretty good but, to be fair, we didn't interact with them much since we were with a large group. The bartenders at the main lobby bar, Carlos in particular, were great."]},

So our round of 9 holes was just under $450, and $300 of it was FOR CARTS!!!  I am disgusted, and appalled that they had the audacity to charge $75 per person for an 8 and a 10 yr old child.  It was a 25-30 minute drive to the course and would have been an hour wait to just leave to get back to our resort.  Be very aware if you plan to golf here.

Initially, all seemed fine at check-in, we exchanged numbers on WhatsApp, and we tried using our butler to ask about restaurant reservations, etc the first day we were there. By the second day, the lack of affirmative responses to our questions or lengthy delays confirming something for us made it a hassle and we gave up using him for the rest of the trip. Additionally, my girlfriend was trying to surprise me and have the room decorated for my birthday. She later told me this was a fiasco. The butler didn't decorate the room on the day he said he would and he also didn't hang a banner on the door as my girlfriend had requested. Basically, we found the butler option to provide little value. And, despite doing very little for us during our stay, he was there at the main lobby to say good-bye to us and it was very clear he was still expecting to be tipped. We spoke to other guests who had a completely different experience and their butler was attentive and even anticipated certain needs of the guests. So, in short, the butler service might be a toss-up depending on who you are assigned."]},

Using glass cups for most drinks was always a pleasure. There were always little things I would noticed that showed that the resort opted to go green vs the alternative.

Our favourite night was the love night- the singers were so so good! In the day the staff were so energetic always dancing around the pool and you were always welcomed to get involved in activities but never harassed to!

As we walked up the impressive main entrance, our luggage being dealt with by some chaps who had been stood outside, I was so looking forward to that refreshing towel and drink people speak of, as you arrive.

I think my significant other was more concerned about the lack of a butler, as it was a missed opportunity for her to be able give instructions out, to someone other than myself.", "Time to see if all the other reviews were somewhere near correct.

I can confirm that had I started looking at the condition of this room, straight away upon arrival, beginning at the entrance door where the door frame was coming adrift, then working my way through the room to the edge of the balcony, the snag list would have been long. As it was, we required a shower, food/drink and some sleep would have been nice. My partner did inspect the mini bar supplied, its one of her duties apparently.

There was a plate of fruit and a bottle of fizz on ice awaiting us.", "OK, ready for the room appraisal? After the first few days, these snags were the most prevalent.", "Already mentioned the entrance door frame, hairline crack in one of the bathroom sinks. The shower/jacuzzi/wet room glass doors out of alignment and awkward to open/close. Thus making use of the \u2018rain shower\u2019 a non-starter as the water would flood through the gaps into the room. The normal shower was no where near as bad, which I used to flush the dead cockroach into the grate (the one and only brush I had with nasty insects I hasten to add). Bathroom ceiling had obviously suffered some water damage over time and was in poor state of repair. Air-Con noisy, the higher you set the fan level, the louder it got. Ceiling fan noisy/squeaking. Room safe unreliable on one too many occasions and usually at the most inconvenient times (but rectified reasonably quickly). Balcony patio doors totally out of alignment and not at all easy to open/close. Furniture inside and on balcony, very basic/worn. The issues with \u2018smelly\u2019 aromas in the rooms were hit and miss. Any traces of sewage smell was brief and usually first thing in the morning when the hotel drainage system was obviously getting a beating.", "Otherwise, everything else in the room did the job it was designed to do. Oh yes, the room bath tub is big enough for two adults, if you get my drift?", "During our visit to Chic, we had the privilege of meeting several different butlers who would be servicing us. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, the idea of a butler sounds quite Gucci, but to be honest we are perfectly capable of doing most things ourselves. So we decided that these chaps would be of most use just booking restaurants and addressing any minor issues we may encounter. Some guests were using their butlers for quite a number of things, including carrying towels to and from the pool. In saying that, perhaps if we had utilised them more, we may have been provided a few surprises like other guests speak of. ", "Taking into account that we were celebrating both of our birthdays and an anniversary, we got very little. Not even a bath prepared, intimate dinner, not a sniff of a gazebo.

But we didn\u2019t make a big thing out it, not worth the aggravation.", "As for the Diamond Club on the whole. Hardly used the Club Lounge. Too small and were constantly running out of stuff.

The afternoon we visited to try the food was a total and epic failure. It was rammed with guests.

The staff of course, it should have been obvious he had been overdoing it, but continued to serve him alcohol. The staff seemed more concerned about serving the \u2018big tippers\u2019 on the beach rather than those who had just come in for a bite to eat. Not impressed! The non-Diamond Club main beach appeared more appealing if I\u2019m honest, not as crowded and access to food/drink probably better.", "Perhaps the Diamond Club had been over-subscribed with guests upgrading to Diamond Club Amenities only.

Because of the nature of its use, i.e.: drunk/selfish guests fearing the swim up bar will collapse if they move away from it, a congealed mass of scum, cigar/cigarette ends, straws, food and other associated debris congregates at corners of the water there. And by the end of the day, it does not smell or look too good.", "Alcohol: I\u2019m sorry to report that most of the people suggesting that the strength of the drinks is lack lustre maybe right. I\u2019m not the biggest drinker in the world, but on some days, when I decided to let down the very little hair that I have left, and with the amount I drank, I should have been a lot more worse for wear than I was. Funnily enough, at some of the bars, if you stood watching whilst they made the drinks, it usually prompted a reasonable taste of alcohol. But you can\u2019t be at the bars all the time watching them being poured.", "The main bar in the lobby at night is perhaps somewhere you should be watching what is going in your glass. I\u2019m sure they served a glass of washing up water one night, which I hasten to add tastes a little less of alcohol than the beer did.", "Main Restaurants: Enough has been said, no complaints at all from us re the food. Service a tad patchy at times. I ate many things for the first time and surprised myself.", "The dress codes clearly displayed at each restaurant, appear not to be enforced by staff. \u2018Wear what ever you like\u2019 would probably be a better interpretation. ", "I have some sympathy for those who have experienced the loud and quite repetitive music that is played, at some very odd times of the day. Now I like music of various genres, sometimes quite loud, sometimes at a level where one is able to relax. But at one point I honestly thought that I had been invited to a Gangster\u2019s Party. If the entertainment team were wondering where a lot of the guests had gone, from around the pool one particular afternoon, they should have looked no further than the beach. That was where most guests were seeking sanctuary from several hours of drum and bass, along with some very over enthusiastic member of staff, rapping away (or shouting is probably a better description) on a radio microphone. This went on for far too long. It was not entertaining. Where was the power cut when it was most needed?", "During the day, it really is a case of finding somewhere that suits you. There is no escaping the more than occasional, relentless high volume of shouting/music totally. Some decent headphones may help, but if you are thinking of returning to the room for a nap, forget it. The Diamond Club rooms face onto the mayhem.", "But in saying that, when some of the activities begin at the pool, it is organised quite well. The foam party, inflatables, fitness classes etc. are commentated and accompanied with an appropriate level of sound and only for an hour or so, and dare I say, with some mirth mixed in. Now, I am not sure what happened as our holiday went on, but the \u2018Gangster Parties\u2019 appeared to get toned down quite a lot during the day, so perhaps some guests had a word with management.", "So this brings me onto the issue of sunbed reserving. One of my many pleasures on holiday, is awaking quite early to sit on the balcony, enjoying watching the sun rising with a hot caffeine enriched beverage. Now this is usually somewhere around 6am. Whilst taking in the marvellous vista, I witnessed guests marching down to the pool and beach armed with multiple towels. The swathes of beds being taken, which I hasten to add were the ones with parasols, which are in too short supply, were the favourites. And half of those were not even used until at least past mid-day. Yes, it really does grip my colon! The bad news is, that this appears to be tolerated, regardless of the many signs erected explaining quite clearly that this practice is NOT tolerated. Some would make an effort to sit on the chairs for a couple of minutes, then they would scuttle off sheepishly. More than likely back to bed for a couple of hours, or perhaps a few rounds of golf? These on going selfish actions could be alleviated a little by the hotel investing in more shade/parasols perhaps? And the earliest I witnessed these desperate people carrying out this ritual? 0530hrs!!", "And so to the beach. We always make a point to walk a few miles post breakfast, before spending the day doing very little. The first few days were a complete success in attaining a suitable walking distance, however as the days rolled on we found most of the route being cut off by a multitude of sargassum, which rolled in relentlessly, wave after wave. This is a natural phenomenon, not the fault of any of the hotels. They do their level best to keep it at bay on their respective beaches, but sometimes it gets overwhelming. On a more positive note, I saw very little (if any) of the usual beach pollution, plastics and the like.", "Evening entertainment, is on the whole quite reasonable. Please refer to previous posters on this forum regarding night time frolics, they appear quite accurate. ", "Perhaps its not quite the right time to book a Michael Jackson Tribute Act. What a strange atmosphere in the Main Lobby Bar that evening. Some predictable comments from the audience. Whatever your thoughts about the artist, this act was borderline entertainment. Probably because the other tribute acts on other evenings were so good. At the end of this show, guests were invited to have photos taken with \u2018Michael Jackson\u2019. I could not help thinking, who on earth would you show the pictures to when you got home?", "The public toilets had many issues. Urinals/toilets blocking up on a regular basis, hand dryers not working etc. Not entirely the fault of the hotel, more a case of some guests being a little too adventurous with what they deposit in the toilet. Used paper is supposed to go in the bins provided, or you could just be a tad more economical when doing the \u2018paperwork\u2019.", "So, if you are left thinking we had a sub-par holiday at Royalton Chic, well no. Its what we made of it. A little improvisation and adaptation meant we made the best of what they were prepared to offer. We had great weather, ate very well and when given the opportunity we relaxed, which is some of the main reasons for going on holiday. ", "When you look at most of the reviews for this hotel, they are very positive and in some cases repeat guests. I would respectfully request that you also take into account that a vast number of guests are only resident for 4-5 days. They can go for a complete \u2018blow out\u2019 for that short period and then return home. I wonder how they would find it after 10+ days?", "You will also note that a lot of reviews mention the same names of staff members over and over again. Before leaving this hotel, we were given a piece of card with the names of the entertainment team on it. It was put to us, that perhaps, we should put these names in the body of a review. May I add that this was the only contact I had with any member of this team. So why on earth would I name any of them?", "In conclusion, enjoy your time at the Chic Royalton if you are planning a trip there. Be prepared to witness a little more partying than you may be used to, and don\u2019t have too higher expectations of the Diamond Club thing. It is a better option, if you have the funds, but its a tad over hyped by the company. It needs tweaking somewhat to get it anywhere near the level of \u2018luxury\u2019 they suggest it is for every member.", "Value for money? ", "Jury is still out on that one."]},

There were a few parties. The white party on the beach was fun. Also, the foam party at the adults only pool was a blast and most fun I had the whole time. I think they could do better with having more entertainment options. ", "We went on 2 excursions. Both booked through Nexus tours with the operator on site at the resort.

This might sound ridiculous and I usually keep my reviews to positives and negatives only, so forgive me for straying. ", "The positives:", "Reserve section of the resort is very nice, if you are wondering which is better the reserve here or at Palma Real, both are good, with the design slightly better at Palma Real. Just to clarify, as I\u2019ve seen some mistakes, there are no swim up suites at the reserve in Paradisus Punta Cana. In fact the rooms are divided into two categories, those that face the pool, and those that face the road. Hence, ask for pool view. There are three floors and unless you have mobility issues or a stroller, ask for the higher floor. It will give you more privacy, better view and less noise. The rooms that face the road are a bad choice because of the trolleys and other vehicles which pass by constantly.  ", "The reserve section has one large pool, one kids pool and a baby pool. Very convenient for everyone. The seating is spread out with multiple Bali beds and soft loungers, set up in a way so that no one is right next to you, unless it\u2019s your own family and friends. My friend and I disagreed about the beds, she didn\u2019t think they were clean enough. I suppose she may have been right, and they should be cleaned more often. You put a towel down first, so it\u2019s not a huge deal. Unfortunately guests were messy, and the staff had to really keep on top of it. The worst was a dirty diaper someone left next to a bed we were using, who does that? It was removed of course, but come on guys, use a garbage can! The grounds are cared for daily, and the flowers were beautiful. Gardners were collecting coconuts and all you had to do was ask, and there you are with a great drink. Please tip them, they work hard. I also noticed that no one was waiting for a handout, meaning that if you didn\u2019t have cash and asked for something extra, special drink, scuba lesson in the pool, they were not going to chase you down. ", "Another note about the rooms, they are not so much in bad shape as some have mentioned, but more prone to neglect by management. Little things make a difference especially when everything else is pretty great. We had a broken shelf in the bathroom, markings on the granite, and a crooked dresser drawer. All this could be fixed within an hour, but somehow it wasn\u2019t. My friends said, are you buying the place? And I decided to let it go, I didn\u2019t really want handymen in my room fixing anything. ", "The food and drinks. The buffet at the reserve is a great place for breakfast and lunch. We all liked the small pre made portions which looked and tasted delicious. Small coconuts with fruit, salads cut in different varieties, fresh made egg omelettes in the mornings, and plantains prepared differently. Everything was replenished and fresh. Desserts also good. Drinks are best at the beach bar, a great bartender will be happy to customize your beverage made with fresh fruits, this gentleman is Lous, and if he\u2019s there, consider yourself lucky, he is awesome! If you need assistance and don\u2019t know whom to ask, he is the person, his English is perfect. As others have mentioned the beach area for the reserve guests is very nice. Even without a personal concierge and in a busy season we were always able to find a spot in the shade, with very comfy beds and lounge chairs. We were closer to the back, if you want the front row I suppose you need a concierge. Spots are reserved and guarded, so we stuck to the back. ", "The beach. Some have noted that they could not swim, because of high waves. Please note that this changes daily, we indeed had more days when the water was a bit rough, this did not mean we didn\u2019t swim, just meant we had to be careful walking in. If you are uncomfortable with this consider booking somewhere else, so as not to ruin your vacation. The water is clean and on the calmer days, it\u2019s very clear. The sand is beautiful and kids had a blast playing in it. We went sailing on one of the days when the surf was rough, it was difficult to get out to the open water and even worse getting back in, as it seemed that a high wave was going to tip the boat over. It didn\u2019t, but we got yelled at for not jumping off quickly enough. I thought this was a bit rude, and also created panic, rather than actual help. The kids ended up staying on land, this was too dangerous. As the saying of an old commercial goes, we did have some good weather on the day we left. The ocean was calm, but we didn\u2019t get a chance to sail with our daughter, hopefully next year!"]},

Here, they charge.  We have kids, we can\u2019t hit the bar, our excitement is a bottle of wine after they fall asleep.

If you choose to do it on your own then you can keep your own time schedule and pay for your taxi.", "- Grounds are beautiful very well-maintained and the grounds keepers are working diligently every day to make it as pretty as it is.", "-Bar staff is great especially if you give them a little extra in tips (shout out to Carlos at the Castle Bar he was great) - One thing to keep in mind is that premium alcohol is not included and is extra.

Never say you can do something and then don\u2019t deliver on the promise - all that does is continue to add disappointment and our room was never cleaned at 10am for our entire stay.", "- the front desk staff disappointed again on the day before check out.... we head over to get a copy of our bill and notice we were not issued a $200 credit.

Well as it turns out when they moved us over they moved us into the imperial suite (room 3048 versus the 3047 I had originally requested because Alex (our check in guy) said no you want 3048 we have re-numbered the rooms - never once saying it wasn\u2019t the honeymoon suite).

{"hotel": ["Catalonia Punta Cana Golf & Casino Resort"], "title": ["Amazing resort with some deficiencies (long and detailed)"], "content": ["My fianc\u00e9 and I stayed 4/21-4/25 in privileged Villa 6 and had a wonderful time. The room was modern  and updated with rainfall shower heads, a king bed, and a hammock on the balcony. The tv had mostly Spanish tv stations so we tried to find English ones for when we went to bed. Our view was somewhat of the pool but we loved the privacy/breeze of the palm trees while we relaxed on our balcony. We were two Villas (short distance) from the privileged beach and Pure (privileged) bar. We were 100 feet down the path from the pool. We ate at Mikado and loved the presentation and quantity of food. Tasty and freshly made in front of you. We ate at Toscana and were barely acknowledged. Other waiters were more attentive but ours was not. We were given very small portions of food (3 raviolis for me and a handful of gnocchi for him). We ended up getting burgers and pizza from the poolside restaurant later that night (those were good, but only after a couple of drinks). Kind of seemed like we\u2019re bothering the guy when we rolled up around 12 am even though they\u2019re open until 2 am. We loved the grand buffet and all the variations of food. Lots of fresh fruit, crepes, churros, breads, traditional Dominican dishes (rice, beans, stewed chicken, boiled potatoes etc). Their sweets selections was usually good with cookies, ice creams, tartes, muffins and little cakes. Even though we were \u201cprivileged\u201d we were never seated close to the terrace like others have said. However because of that we met our favorite waitress at the buffet. If I remember correctly her name was Delmaria but I\u2019m not 100% sure. Every morning she made sure our water and coffee was plentiful. We did have breakfast and lunch one time at the beach buffet but the selection was barely half of the grand buffet so we didn\u2019t go back. We loved the coffee shop by the shopping area and the girls were always pleasant. The shopping area was great with a mini market and souvenir shops. While on the beach a photographer came and took professional quality pictures which we were able to look at and purchase later that night at the photography store. The beach was beautiful and postcard worthy. There were plenty of beach chairs but not enough umbrellas or shaded areas. We are both fair skinned and required somewhere in the shade. Usually we could find an umbrella but people did reserve chairs in the early morning and didn\u2019t come back until later in the morning or midday. The only the downfall was there are a lot of big rocks and boulders in the water and we stepped on and kicked them plenty of times. However once you got passed those rocks there ", "was beautifully clear water and a natural sandbar/channel past the buoys where you could stand up and the water would only come up to your thighs. We brought our own water goggles and could swim around and see the schools of fish. The seaweed was abundant but it\u2019s natural and they do their best to get it off the beach. We didn\u2019t frequent the pool much because it closed by 6 pm everyday so no night swimming evidently. It\u2019s nicely warm, 5\u20194 deep with a swim up a bar and a jacuzzi (not hot ", "though). The resort has beautiful greenery that you walk through with a pond that ducks, turtles, birds, and fish have called home. ", "Now the only things we didn\u2019t appreciate were their selling tactics and solicitation. We arrived at 4 pm after a long day of traveling and were excited to finally be there. The girl who checked us in mentioned that the beach club next door was 20% off if we decided to book a day there. I kindly acknowledged her but knew we weren\u2019t interested. Then as we were ready to get to our room, her friend had been waiting for us to be done so she could sit us down and talk some more. She was friendly and asked if we had any questions about the map or where to go. But then she wanted to know how we arrived to the hotel. I told her the shuttle company and she pretended to play dumb that she had never heard of them. Then she handed me this sort of packet and said \u201coh I know who who dropped you off, they also go by this name\u201d (name on the packet she just handed me). She proceeded to tell us, not ask, but tell us that the following morning we had to come back at 9:30 and talk to someone from our \u201cshuttle company\u201d (name on packet) to confirm our pick up for when we go home. And when we meet him he also has to give us a small presentation. She also tried to sell us the beach club again for 20% off with free massages, and a lobster dinner and this and that. So we finally escaped off to our room, realized how shady it was that we had to go back the next morning to confirm our pickup (which our shuttle company\u2019s email specifically said we didn\u2019t have to) and didn\u2019t show up for our 9:30 \u201cappointment\u201d. So we really didn\u2019t appreciate their deceptive selling tactics into scaring people that they won\u2019t be picked up if they don\u2019t show up. I\u2019m curious to know how many people fall for it. Also they stand in the main corridor by the buffet and try to sell you stuff. It gets annoying and you dread walking by sometimes. ", "All in all I would still come back as it\u2019s the best resort I\u2019ve been to in my trips in the Caribbean between the Virgin Islands, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico."]},

I was woken up by somebody entering my room which I thought nothing of thinking it was my husband or son. IT WAS ANOTHER COUPLE, WITH KEYS TO MY ROOM, WALKING IN ON ME THINKING IT WAS THEIR ROOM BECAUSE THE FRONT DESK CHECKED THEM INTO OUR ROOM. I was totally shocked and irate. I could not believe something like this happened. The Hard Rock put me in danger. Anything could have happened. What if it was my son in the room taking a nap and not me (he's a teenager but still!!) And what if nobody was in the room, my personal items are all there and could have been stolen. I don't care that their systems were down, this is unacceptable and should have never happened. I can't shake the feeling of somebody walking right in while I was sleeping, hearing a different mans voice!!!!! Then none of our keys worked, they deactivated all out keys. I called the front desk and they told me I needed to go down there to fix it, like it was my fault! Not feeling well, I went to the desk and had to WAIT IN LINE for almost an hour to get new keys all while still very very ill. I just can't believe that the Hard Rock as big as they are let this happen and still have their systems be down once we left. ", "Checking out was another long wait....again because of their systems. I have been to many places,, and nothing like this has ever happened. Typically we've walked into our resort, we are personally greeted and given drinks and walked over to a person at the desk to help us within minutes.

On Sunday and Wednesday, they allowed vendors to come into the resort to sell their items. Some were nice things such as paintings, jewelry, wood sculptures, etc. and some of the vendors were really nice and respected that we didn\u2019t have an interest in their product. However, some of them did not like to take no as an answer and we honestly started to feel uncomfortable and felt disrespected by them. We do not feel we should remove a star for this, as we felt the resort allows the vendors to come in for our advantage and might not be aware of the attitudes of the vendors.

The bathroom had a window at the end of the shower. I thought it was a bit odd as there were balconies right outside the window!?! After about 3 minutes, the shower water also went cold. I rented a car and was able to venture out to different areas to explore. The driving in the area was a little erratic, and a lot of locals didn't know where the hotel was when I needed some directions.

Our tub drain broke and wouldn\u2019t release the water which makes a jetted tub useless. I called and when the maintenance man came he literally twisted wire around the drain knob to hold it together. That failed the first use. I called again. This time they removed the drain and set it on the tub deck. Again, a jetted tub without a drain is pretty useless. I ended up having to take the drain AND knob to the lobby, find the resort manager, tell her I was going to dinner and when I got back I expected it fixed which it finally was. She also acknowledged that both previous attempts were unacceptable.", "With the drain fixed, I thought we were good. I was wrong. Tuesday night we had winds that were higher than normal, but not storm grade by any means. Something came loose on the roof and banged all night long keeping me awake. I didn\u2019t expect them to go on the roof in the wind and the dark so I called Wednesday morning and asked them to find and fix it. Then I called Thursday morning. Then I gave up and listened to it bang on the roof until we left Saturday.", "Staff: Very happy friendly people that usually have very little clue what you are saying to them. I\u2019m talking even the people that check you in and take your food orders. Communication at the resort is poor from a sharing information perspective and then on top of that, the language barrier is HUGE! Not all of them, but most for sure. For example, when we checked in the lady said our room was what sounded like \u201c13\u201d. I repeated it back to her and she said \u201cyes\u201d. I went to book an excursion why we waited for our room and told the Delta vacation excursion representative our room was 13 when he asked. He informed me it wasn\u2019t 13 and said \u201cI\u2019ll be right back\u201d. He came back and said \u201cyour room is 3010\u201d.", "I went to the coffee bar in the lobby and ordered a \u201cblack coffee with cream\u201d 3 times within 45 minutes from the same lady. I received an espresso first, then a cappuccino and then finally a black coffee with cream. 80% of the time I ordered food it came out wrong. The bars were fine though so I guess that Sanctuary feels if they keep you drunk you won\u2019t care about all the wrong food. ", "Food: This brings us to food. Everyone I talked to at the resort was sick of the food by the 2nd or 3rd day, EVERYONE. The fruit, was great. The veggies pretty good. The seafood very good. When they got off that reservation, it all went wrong. ", "Lets start with the taco truck everyone raved about, one word, awful. The food didn\u2019t even come from the truck it came from the burger bar. It was gross. We ordered 4 different things and of course, due to the language barrier, got 2 of what we ordered and something we didn\u2019t and never got the 4th. It was hard, overcooked crap. The buffet and all the other restaurants were mediocre with a lot of the same items. The seafood restaurant serves pizza. Not seafood pizza, regular pizza and there is already a pizzeria at Sanctuary town. It basically boiled down to this: we would like half of what we ordered and we ordered stuff we usually like. The beach bar had good burgers and the rest of the stuff was pretty scary looking. ", "The buffet was HIGHLY repetitive, like 90% repetitive. Anything that should be hot was room temp and anything that should be cold was room temp. The only exception was the \u201cmade to order\u201d stuff like eggs. That would be hot, but overcooked. For example, I ordered sunny side up eggs that had yolks that were rock hard.", "Then there are some outright fabrications on the part of SCC regarding restaurants. They call the restaurant at the castle the Ocean Bar and Restaurant which serves breakfast and lunch daily. It is a bar for sure, but unless you consider some fruit and a broken coffee maker sitting on the bar to be breakfast, it isn\u2019t a \u201crestaurant\u201d. The lunch menu is burgers and that is it.", "I would never return to this place simple because of the food. I paid $2k/person for my wife and I too go here. While I was there, a guy I know was at one of the cheaper resorts and he said the food was about as crappy as mine, but he paid $700/person for his trip. They had similar pools and similar restaurants and similar bars with just cheaper grade liquor, and they had an ocean---$1300 less per person.", "Bars: Open 10am. Beach bar, not pool bar was the best. All the bars were good though. Great liquor and things were made correctly at all times.", "Pools & hot tub: They are pools and there are 5. They are clean as they should be, otherwise there is nothing extraordinary about them. There is what is supposed to be a hot tub, but the whole time I was there, there was no heat and one of the jets had blown out so there was one big geyser and no other jets worked.", "Activities: all lame games you need to be completely drunk for: throwing darts, sand bowling, etc. etc. 1 foam party and 1 beach party, no theater. Dancing at the PM bar in the evening after 10:30pm. Most of the resorts do the same or better.", "Language barrier: HUGE! I have already given several examples of it\u2019s effect. Even people in key positions DO NOT have a working knowledge of English and it will DEFINITELY affect the quality of your vacation.", "In closing: there are A LOT of resorts being built in the Dominican Republic. Competition will only get stiffer. Sanctuary Cap Cana will degrade and fade if they do not step up their game. You have a beautiful resort, but people want value for their money and you do not offer it."]},

The shower was nice to have the rainfall and the handheld, but somehow I always managed to flood the bathroom.  I think we needed more training than we got when we got there. The facial at the spa was nice but maybe overpriced for the 50 minutes and the type of treatment.  Food was good.  Lots of variety.  Gluten free options were plentiful.  Only thing I would add is better/more nightly entertainment.  If you stay at the resort, there's not much to do other than hang in the bars and after drinking all day, we were looking for a bit more activity at night.  And to somehow fix the noise level.

With that said, we were the fourth room in our line and it took two hours. When we got to the desk, we were told our room (part of the wedding block) was not quite ready. This was at 5 PM. We've worked in a hotel in the past so understand things can happen so didn't protest and or cause a scene but offered to take a room in a different building because at this point we had a wedding welcome night cocktail party in less than two hours.

She hung up.", "Next thing I know I have a staff member in my room trying to fix/clean stuff. Not what I asked for. I had been clear that we wanted to move the following day but had no time to deal with this today. The employee now in my room as we are trying to get ready to go to this event speaks zero English and we cannot get him to stop working and let us get ready. I attempt to communicate in what could aptly be described as broken Spanish and he's still not understanding me. I'm far from fluent, but I had far less trouble a few years ago in Barcelona. Anyways, I finally got my message across and he left.", "Luckily we were rarely in the room, but additionally, we had issues like water being restocked on one day but not the alcohol and then the next day the opposite.

The rest of my girls and I also made great friends with Viktor (Prelude bar staff), Elephet (who nicknames himself \"elephant\") and Jesus.

Reception gave me an \"allergen card\" so I didn't have to worry about fighting the language barrier when explaining what gluten-free is - the Onyx staff (Jesus in particular) even started remembering I was gluten-free and explaining my allergy to other staff as the week progressed! Ate at Breathless - the neighboring resort - one night and the staff were confused and I ended up eating gluten. Aka be careful about gluten free at the Breathless resort!

", "The overall ambience of the resort was relaxing and absolutely beautiful. It is about 15 minutes from the Punta Cana airport and located in a very safe area. You go through 2 guard shacks - 1 about 5 minutes from the resort and 1 at the resort entrance. I was worried about the safety around the resort, but this was very reassuring and the sanctuary staff is very cognizant and careful about all vehicles coming in and out of the gates. The location is a bit far from the excursions in Punta Cana, but that was okay for us. They all offered hotel pick up. ", "We stayed in the castle oceanfront suite. It was beautiful and spacious. The castle was so unique and luxurious. A few things to note about the room- there is a safe, stocked mini fridge, jetted tub, rainfall shower, robes, the AC worked great, and it came with a butler. We are very low maintenance people so we rarely needed the butler\u2019s help but he checked in with us frequently and made our dinner reservations for the week. ", "The beach- like other reviews mentioned, the beach is small and there is a lot of seaweed. It isn\u2019t ideal for swimming, however the public beach is right next to the castle and is a much better beach for swimming. The beach at SCC had tons of loungers and cabanas and was a very nice intimate beach. ", "Pools- a lot of reviews said that it was hard to find chairs unless you got there extremely early. We did not have this problem. We hopped around to the different pools throughout the days and there were always open chairs and plenty of clean towels. The staff constantly made sure the guests had a drink and were satisfied, but I never felt like they were bugging us. The pools were all extremely clean and perfect temperature. The staff works like crazy to keep the outdoor areas in perfect condition. All of the pools are a very relaxed and quiet environment. The main pool has more of a party atmosphere, but even then it was very calm. ", "The food and drinks- we really never had anything we didn\u2019t like. If you are a picky eater, do not come with high expectations as the resort specializes in unique dishes, not the basic American fare. The blue marlin restaurant served great seafood\u2014 we had the cod and bass. the steakhouse was wonderful and my steak was cooked perfectly to my expectation. Capriccio the Italian restaurant was wonderful but the portions were smaller. The fried calamari was the best I\u2019ve ever had. The taco truck and pizza restaurant were very good and the burger factory was fantastic. We didn\u2019t come to eat typical American food, but I was pleasantly surprised. The wok restaurant was excellent and fun to watch the chef. The breakfast and lunch buffet had tons of selections. Some were the same everyday but they also mixed up the offerings. This is where picky eaters probably have a hard time finding something they like. There is a lot of typical Dominican dishes on the buffet but we loved it. The drinks were always great and not watered down. My only complaint is that they chill their red wine\u2014 as a red wine lover this is a huge pet peeve of mine. ", "The staff\u2014 amazing. Their customer service is a 10/10. They are genuinely friendly and care about the guests. We never had a bad or questionable interaction. At check in, we were immediately driven to the castle lobby and greeted with champagne by our butler. Every staff member we passed would greet us with a smile. I\u2019m sure this is a great place to work as they all seemed to have a great time and were very passionate about their work. They were also very professional. On our last evening we were eating outside next to one of the pools. A staff member who was cleaning found a purse that a guest left under a pillow in a cabana. He wouldn\u2019t touch it and immediately paged a senior staff member. When he got there, they both walked the purse over to the front desk. I really admired how they handled finding the purse and it speaks a lot about the integrity of the staff and management. ", "We absolutely loved sanctuary cap Cana and would definitely return.

If you want to become rich, find a way to stop the sea weed from getting to the beach. This same thing happened in Riviera Maya recently, and it's disappointing when you see the beautiful blue water but you really can't go in because of the amount of seaweed between you and that blue water. We hardly went in the water and That would've made me think twice about the 4 vs 5 star rating.  Esteban at the beach bar was great and outshined all of his coworkers.

Absolutely beautiful. Staff. Awesome. EXCEPT for the all inclusive check in. We waited for over 2 hours for 1 of our 2 rooms. They advertise express check in. I get it. 1 room ready. Could have sent us to Prefered Lounge to wait for keys but didn\u2019t. They pointed us down stairs to world cafe for lunch and assured us both rooms would be ready after we ate. Not the case. We came back upstairs, they said to hang out in one room and all the luggage will be delivered there while the room was cleaned. It took a few hours. No big deal. We all had a room to clean up and hang out. Had a stocked mini bar which made it easier. The wife had to go back up to lobby to get a pitch on time shares and gift coupons that amounted to nothing. So by getting the preferred club check in up charge, that didn\u2019t matter. The preferred club option other than that was great. Access to breakfast and lunch at Oceanas for breakfast and lunch. Top shelf drinks made a difference. Rooms. As i said. Stayed different island all inclusive stays before. Rooms are dated but clean. We had rooms next to one another. Pool. Awesome. Swim up bars. Awesome. No problem getting lounge chairs at all. Preferred gives you beach bed access. No problem getting those no matter what time of day. Roped off. Nobody else is allowed there. The preferred lounge actually has some good food all day long. Dilbert is an awesome bartender and I screwed him with a big tip because he was off when we left. Sorry dude.   Building 6 is right next to preferred club and 3 restaurants. Good place to stay. And it\u2019s close to the ocean. 2 minute walk at most. If you have stayed all inclusive at TOP resorts in the past, relax, you get what you pay for here and then some. Biggest asset they have is their entertainment staff and their waiters and waitresses. Shows are typical. Fire show. Acrobatic stuff. Dancing etc. I do recommend shutting it down after 11. Avoid the casino and disco. Disco opens at 11. My 21 year old got jammed up there one night. Swears someone slipped something in the drink. Was blasted. Didn\u2019t remember anything. Lots of weddings going on so expect a lot of single people for a \u201cfamily\u201d resort.

The reason is that this Zoetry apparently has no designated area to hold performances and weddings, etc. For that reason they have chosen a garden area adjoining the oceanfront suites to cordon off and set up chairs for events.  This area was about 10 feet away from our room, meaning the loud amplified music and other sounds were so loud in our room that on two of our last three nights our $1000.00 room was pretty much uninhabitable.

You could do a whole bunch of water sports--though most people don't. Snorkeling and diving seems a bit much since there aren't vibrant reefs and fish or anything here. The beach front is well protected, so no waves despite being oceanside.", "We had a complimentary spa massage--which was amazing. The staff know how to work out those knots! We were a little disappointed that elective (not included in your stay) packages were so expensive, $300-400 per person. But the hot tub room was a nice oasis to get away from the beach!", "Restaurants were nice atmospheres. The food was generally good, but perhaps not as nice as going out to eat at a fancy restaurant in the U.S. We would have liked another option for lunch, other than just Indigo, or at least an expanded menu to choose from. We had come back to the same menu items for lunch a couple of times. We really enjoyed Olena (the Italian restaurant) because it had a great antipasti bar and bread/dipping oil. But we felt that the dishes could have been better explained on the menu or better paired. For instance, we order a shrimp and peppers with garlic sauce--expecting it to come with pasta since it was a main dish. It did not. If you want something, generally you have to specify to get it. But we felt that asking for pasta at an Italian place was a bit of a reach. Amaya (think fancy) and Piragua were good and fancier. We did order steak our first night - which had a great gorgonzola onion sauce, but our steaks (ordered to be medium rare and medium) were quite rare--so we left the cold centers on the plate.", "Everyone who comes gets $200 in resort credit, but what isn't advertised until you get there is that you have to spend it on certain items. Two $40 credits for spa packages (that range $95-400), one $20 for a spa facial package, four $10 credits for \"upscale\" (not included) wine--e.g. the first night was Yellowtail for $32 (yikes), and a $60 credit toward a $250-300 romantic dinner on the beach. Take that as you will, we were fine to eat dinner first and then go for a walk on the beach for free! In sum, we didn't use any of the resort credits sadly--a poor marketing tactic.", "We were a bit disappointed that advertised activities such as cooking classes, cocktail making classes, dancing lessons, wine and rum tasting were not offered during our 6 day stay. We were happy to enjoy the food, beaches, free massage and free horseback ride, but would have liked to do these activities.", "Overall, this was a wonderful stay with great staff service and a great, private beach front. P.S. - Find the outside hot tub, complete with cold champagne service, and the cafe serves chocolate truffles and treats in the afternoons!"]},

The main issue was translating what was being said. I learned quickly that my google translation app was going to be my best friend on this trip! You may notice that in a earlier review someone mentioned this is a \u201cparty\u201d resort.. this is 1/2 true! We were put in a room initially that didn\u2019t have any view and near the main pool and all we heard were people laughing loud and enjoying themselves. I wanted tranquility.. I also wanted to be in the newer building where all my friends were.. which is AMAZING and quiet! They moved us there. I can see where the older rooms would be fun for folks looking for that energy. The main pool is party time but don\u2019t worry, there are a few other pools. The infinity pool was my favorite, less crowded and tranquil. The castle pool was also very nice.. the people... all so nice!! Ray who was our main waiter in the morning at breakfast was amazing!  He remembered what we liked and on the second day had our table all ready.. he also was a waiter at the sushi restaurant and we dined there as well and he showed us all a good time.. the last 2 days we were there, he wasn\u2019t our waiter as they moved him around. We felt he was best presented with people and not in the back kitchen as support.  Gingette and Super Jery (yery) were also amazing.  We spent a couple nights at dinner at the steakhouse and super jery helped us along with Gingette. I can\u2019t forget to mention the front desk folks who were also very helpful.  We left the resort one time and went to scape park.  It was great great!  We swam in the cave natural waters.. quite the hike and I\u2019m not a hiker.. see photos. You just need to find it!  Don\u2019t go to the big swim hole.. (I mean it was great, but when we visited, it was so crowded with a large party).  We found a small cave swim place way up there and it was amazing. So fresh and just beautiful. The whole experience was nice .. I don\u2019t know that we will ever visit DR in the future because there are so many other places we haven\u2019t seen, but this will be a trip to remember for sure. "]},

The crew member with us in the water would swim around with fish food, squeezing out the feed from a water bottle so the same set of fish would swim underneath us.There was no coral and it just looked dead. That part was a complete joke but the rest of the day was good so we just chalked it up to getting to float around for a little bit. After this, we stopped by a sandbar area and drank rum and cokes until it was time to get back in the boat and head to lunch. For lunch, we arrived at this beautiful white sandy beach in Cap Cana.

I will start with the positives. The resort is beautiful, very lush and tropical. The grounds are well maintained and clean. I love seeing the flamingos, even the teenagers loved them! The pools are clean and we were always able to find a pool raft, a shaded or quiet spot when we wanted to. The preferred beds at the beach were wonderful, except every so often people would be smoking and it always seemed to blow our way. The beach/water was what to be expected at the ocean. I\u2019ve seen people complain about the waves, the seaweed, whatever. It\u2019s the ocean, Mother Nature is uncontrollable. We loved the beach, the staff did a great job trying to keep the seaweed cleaned up, those gentlemen worked so hard in the sun and heat! I\u2019ve seen people complain there were not enough pool chairs or beach chairs, I always saw plenty of them, more at the beach than the pool, but they were there and available. We were told the hotel was at capacity, being Easter week, and neither were a problem. ", "The staff at this resort is over the top. I\u2019ve been to many resorts, cruises, etc. I\u2019ve encountered friendly staff before, but the staff here was so social. They knew our names and went above and beyond. Shout out to Franklin the butler and Babyface with the entertainment. If you\u2019ve ever travelled with 17 year old girls, you know they can make or break a vacation. Babyface had the girls active and engaged, they took dance lessons, played games, took aerobic classes, things I never expected. Of course, they don\u2019t call him Babyface for nothing, the teenage crush was cute to watch, Babyface kept if professional and never crossed any lines, even started referring to them as his little sisters, to set some boundaries. I never felt uncomfortable with the girls having their freedom, which was definitely a concern before the trip. I worried, as most moms do, of two teenagers walking around all day in a foreign country in their bikinis, but there was no need. The nightly shows were what you would expect, entertaining. The fire show was by far my favorite. ", "The food at the restaurant was between okay and good, nothing truly wow\u2019ed me. The buffet had many choices, all good, but nothing outstanding. The best dinner we had was at the hibachi table, we all enjoyed that. The steakhouse was good, portions small but filling and service was a bit slow. Breakfast and lunch at Oceana was always good, and the view was amazing. We had pizza and burgers, also good. Lunch service at the beach was a treat, again food was good. The Italian restaurant was my least favorite. The coffee shop was always good for a treat and frozen coffee. The Dominican lunch buffet at the beach was probably one of my favorite meals, very good. ", "There were a few \u201cnegatives\u201d, but nothing to ruin a trip or stop a return visit. First would be the check in process, we were there on a particularly busy day and waited in a long line. When we got to the counter we learned that because we were preferred, we did not have to wait in the line and could have gone to the preferred desk. We were hot, tired, hungry and a bit cranky from traveling, so it would have been nice to know that ahead of time.

", "i have mixed feelings about this place.  while it was nice for our 2 year old, i didnt enjoy many aspects.  and the prices were not that cheap, so we expected better.  also, the free $1000 of resort credits are useless, they are small amounts that can only be used for very specific things , so thats basically a useless scam.  also, mosquitos were a huge issue for us.  bring serious mosquito spray because most of the restaurants are outside and there is tons of water (which attract mosquitos) and they did not have anything to combat the problem.  i also never saw a lifeguard at the kids pool or the main pool or the beach."]},

The staff is friendly but speaking Spanish would be helpful. The pool area is large and very nice. Breakfast options were limited but the food was hot. Wish they had a coffee bar.  Other food was okay not great, but they do have a good cheeseburger and hot crispy fries. Fish not so good on one occasion. Decent nachos and guacamole. There is a bar in the attractive open air lobby adjoining the open air dining area and pool. The hotel is not on the beach but they provide a free shuttle on a large golf cart like vehicle. About a 5-6 minute drive. Frequent runs throughout the day but not in the evening. Desk will arrange a cab to get to restaurants or other attractions. A free shuttle to one of the local shopping malls. A nearby mini mart within easy walking distance for bottled water and snacks.

Our kitchen had limited supplies but we made the best of it I did buy a knife that I use periodically and left it there.  There is a safe in our room.

Add shuttle service to a mall as well as the beach and also they made arrangements for us to be picked up to go to the airport which we had to pay $35. When we decided to go out to eat we probably walked about 20 minutes to go downtown to some of the local restaurants. There was another restaurant that was close to us. it's rather expensive and the food is okay you just have to be careful in what you order. Also there's a mini mart which is about 2 minutes from the Karibou where we would frequent. it's very convenient and they also will deliver to your room. There is also at the mall which they have a shuttle for that has a supermarket which has more items are variety that you can get from the Mini Mart.

Although, the herons could potentially become a bit of a nuisance when trying to help themselves to left over food etc (mainly due to greedy guests leaving piles of food that they wanted then left - huge waste!).", "* Main bar we found to be excellent and the service was consistently good (special mention to Eddy who was great).", "* Al la Carte restaurants were a bit hit and miss.. Italian was very tasty but service was unenthusiastic and main course portions were small (maybe have a large lunch if you plan to eat there in the evening).  Japanese was excellent, with generous portions and lots of fun..recommended!  We didn't bother with the Steakhouse as we had heard very mixed opinions.", "* Food in the buffet restaurants (particularly the main one as the beach buffet had been scaled down to allow for renovations) was excellent, with a lot of choice that even the faddiest eater wouldn't snuggle with.", "NEGATIVES:", "* Our main disappointment during our stay surrounded the blatant favouritism of the Spanish speaking guests at the pool and (both) beach bars.  Now, it may be because we are British and believe in a fair 'queuing' system, but most times when trying to request a drink, we were ignored if there were other guests that 'spoke the language'.  This we found to be immensely frustrating, particularly as British and American guests tended to be in the minority here, so a top tip would be to brush up on your Spanish prior to arriving and then don't worry about other waiting guests at the bar as they will not be as important!  ", "* The principle reason we booked this resort was that the rooms contained bath tubs which is important to me personally as I love a good soak.  However, although the room did indeed contain a bath, this was so large that it took an hour to fill and trying to be environmentally 'aware' did not sit comfortably with me.  The room was also a strange layout (possibly as we had a ground floor corner plot?), where to the right when entering there was a shower cubicle and toilet, and opposite on the left housed the bath tub with the wardrobe area, sink and safe!  We discovered that despite all the other rooms having 2 chairs and a table outside, ours only contained one lonely looking chair.  We requested another chair and table, in addition to an ashtray to use outside, and some more hangers. Only the hangers were forthcoming, and my overall impression here was that Tui clearly have a certain allocation of rooms but they don't include some of the better situated and equipped.  As a result, after the first night, we decided to bite the bullet and pay for an upgrade to a 'privileged' room.  This resulted in some irony in that all the new 'privileged' rooms do not contain baths but have 2 showers instead (is one ever enough?)! ", "Once we got settled in the nicer room though we found it to be very comfortable and daily cleaning was of a high standard.  Beyond securing a superior/new room however, not convinced that the other 'perks' were really worth the extra cost.", "* The bars at the pool and beach (as mentioned previously) could often be a bit of a 'bun fight' and the service hit and miss. However, a special mention should be given to Yohan at the pool bar who went out of his way to provide excellent service and was always very happy.", "* Casino:  What a let down!  We were both looking forward to enjoying the odd 'gamble' but this turned out to be a damp squib, with minimum bets ($5) on the roulette table, devoid of atmosphere and rumours of tables being 'rigged'.  Avoid unless you have money to burn!", "Overall, we had a lovely holiday and we tend to take the rough with the smooth when we go away anywhere, but would we return?

", "- Best poolside bartender ever! He was extremely good at making different drinks and always had a smile on his face. ", "- Plenty of beds/chaise lounge chairs on the beach.", "- There are a number of different pools, some of them are empty most of the time. ", "- There are not a lot of rooms unlike some other resorts, so the resort was relatively quiet/ peaceful which we enjoyed a lot", "- We loved how there were a lot of recycling bins around the resort. They should consider doing the same in the room, to encourage recycling.", "- Room service orders were flexible, they allowed guests to order food that was not on the room service menu.", "- Overall, the quality of food was decent.", "- Alejandro arranged a special arrangement dinner at a restaurant for our anniversary celebration/ birthday. The staff even sang a birthday song and brought out a birthday cake!", "Not-so-good:", "- There was only one restaurant open for lunch. Even though the menu option was extensive, it started to get boring after the 3rd day.", "- Quality of the food was hit and miss. Burgers at Indigo restaurant (or room service) were always well-done despite asking to be cooked medium rare. Spaghetti with meat balls tasted pretty bad but the pasta at the Italian restaurant was pretty good. ", "- Every single meal (i.e. breakfast/ lunch/ dinner), it took at least 20-30 mins before someone could take our orders. Despite telling a waiter that we were ready to order, all we got is \"ok\" and left waiting. This was probably the most frustrating thing we experienced during our stay.", "- Room service was extremely slow. Since there is no kettle/ tea bags in the room, we ordered tea from our room (i.e. 1 teabag/ 2 cups/ pot of hot water). Each time we were told it would take about 30-40 mins but it ended up taking 45 mins - 1 hour 30 mins. ", "- There were days when a wedding was held onsite and certain restaurant/ bar would be closed. However, guests were not informed ahead. Assuming this is something that hotel staff would know ahead of time, it would be nice for our concierge to inform us so that we could plan around it.", "- The room could use some updating. The sink faucet, toilet flush button seemed corroded and were not nice to touch.", "- Not all the light fixtures in the room were operational.", "The one thing that really left us with a bad impression was the sales presentation of the Unlimited Vacation club. We were told that it would be a 90 mins (including lunch) sales presentation and it would not take longer than that. They lied.", "We had lunch with a friendly sales lady for almost 80 mins. Most of the time, she bonded with us by asking about our background / travels but not explaining much on how the Unlimited vacation club worked. After lunch, she brought us to a small conference room and started selling us. When the 90 mins was up, she had yet to explain clearly on how this worked or how much it cost. When we got a little annoyed, we told her that we would not be giving her our credit card information today but would like to have the information so that we could think about it. This was when it all went downhill as she started to pressure us and even called one of her supervisor to give us another high pressure sale pitch. We had to give a firm \"no\" before they gave up. This left a really bad taste as the minimum package costs over 50k. Not allowing guests to think it through and pressuring a on-the-spot sale was frustrating. We did however receive a $400 spa credit.", "I hope this review will help other guests to be better prepared shall they be interested in the sales presentation at Zoetry."]},

The resort has two amazing breakfast restaurants, but having breakfast on our balcony, and enjoying the beautiful view was one of our favorite things during our trip.

We just back last night and I already miss it. Everything was top notch and wonderful. Food was delicious, staff was impeccable with their customer service from the staff at the pool (Happy Boy made us feel loved every day at the pool!) to the bellhops, Luis was so attentive to me and my boyfriend. Even the staff that led the daily activities at the pool, Diana and Miguel Angel were outstanding! they greet and talk to you like you've known them for years. Their enthusiasm is infectious. Carlos at the pool bar was a master at mixing. Casabella is their buffet style restaurant that sits overlooking the main pool and beach. Edward was such a great help and gave outstanding service as our waiter. All of the waiters were awesome at all the restaurants at Sanctuary Cap Cana. Visit Fusion restaurant if you go to this resort. it's a live show and dinner revamped in a way that is really cool and engaging. The housekeepers of our room 1013 during May 7-14 were so good! She did an excellent job with decorating the bed with flowers almost everyday and keeping the room smell so fresh. This is my new favorite resort for Dominican Republic."]},
{"hotel": ["Sanctuary Cap Cana"], "title": ["Amazing!!!!"], "content": ["I cannot say enough good things about Sanctuary. From the second we stepped foot onto the resort, the service we received was outstanding. The resort is absolutely beautiful and so are the rooms. We were concerned about the quality of food but absolutely loved Blue Marlin for lunch as the seafood is sooo fresh, the buffet for breakfast, and the steakhouse for dinner. Elben at Blue Marlin is great!!! We reserved a Bali Bed by the beach one day and had him as a butler as well and made our experience unforgettable. For dinner, Capriccio and Wok were both decent but we didn\u2019t love the food there. The last night we went to Fusion and had an amazing time!! If we were to stay an extra night, we would have went to the steakhouse again as we loved it that much. Drinks by the pool and at the piano bar were great too. The only negative is that the beach has a lot of seaweed but the pools are great so we didn\u2019t mind at all. I\u2019ve already recommended this place to so many people."]},
{"hotel": ["Sanctuary Cap Cana"], "title": ["Horrible Customer Service & Value"], "content": ["To say we were disappointed in our stay is an understatement. This \"all-inclusive\" resort is a joke compared to others. The customer service was ATROCIOUS. Everyone was extremely rude and did not make us feel welcome at all. We felt like we were a burden on the staff. The concierge staff were the rudest, most unprofessional people we have EVER dealt with. They gave us one word answers and rushed us along as quickly as possible so they could get back to talking to other staff. The drinks were disgusting and the bar staff were also rude to us. The 'mini-bar' in our room consisted of gross beer and some pop - which is nothing compared to some of the other all-inclusive resorts we've been to. We were so unhappy with everything that we left after two nights when we were planning on being there for 6. I will never, ever recommend this place to a single person. I feel pity towards the couples that think this is a great all-inclusive. You can get TREMENDOUSLY better service and resorts for the same price! PLEASE trust me on this - go elsewhere. Even if you think it is great - it is NOT - there are MUCH, MUCH better resorts our there. I am disgusted we spent money on this place. To management: Your front desk workers and concierge staff are some of the rudest, unprofessional people I have EVER had the displeasure of meeting. You need to DO BETTER with your customer service because it is awful. It would also be great if you would stop up charging for everything. \"All-Inclusive\" is supposed to mean everything is included and it's not okay to charge more for everything."]},

The breakfast and lunch buffets were really good with lots to choose.  On our final night The Seafood Restaurant set up a large table for our final meal with new friends,   They did an excellent job cooking the fish my husband and his fishing companions caught on their fishing trip.   Being from Louisiana and loving fresh fish, they did a really good job, they grilled and fried the fish and provided all the fixing.  A wonderful final dinner with new friends.

We really enjoyed Yurki, she served us cocktails every night, she was full of grace and treated us like VIP. She took such good care of us and took time to visit with us.   We had the pleasure of being served by Ray at the Wok and Breakfast.   He was such a joy, always a big smile and my husband let him choose his entree and dessert options at the Wok and he did an excellent job.    There were other staff members we sadly did not get their names, but from our arrival the staff was so special, the beach staff was fun and attentive.  The buffet staff were always so welcoming in the morning.  Bright shining stars all of them.

The suite exceeded our expectations and sitting in the comfy chairs on the balcony with morning coffee and gentle surf was so relaxing. We had some trouble with our A/C and the staff responded instantly. Unfortunately is was not going to be a quick fix and the wonderful staff in the Castle apologized for the inconvenience and moved us to a swim up suite in the Castle. It was not necessary to upgrade us but, that is typical of the staffs approach to customer service. Everyone employee here is interested in your day and if there is anything they can do for you. The reception people in the Castle, our butler Santo.

However, it was the staff who made the experience truly unforgettable. Everyone was friendly and helpful. A special mention has to go to the Entertainment Team. If you wanted to simply chill, they weren't pushy, but if you were up for some fun then that is exactly what they made it with their infectious enthusiasm. We particularly enjoyed the volleyball, pool games and dancing. You'll get used to their nicknames, but to those who have been, they will understand when I say thanks to Bruno Mars, Jackie Brawn, and Black Coffee :)"]}
