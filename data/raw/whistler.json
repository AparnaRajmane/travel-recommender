The second drawback was the smoke alarm! I know we have to be safe, given that there is a kitchen in the apartment, however, positioning the alarm directly above the oven is not the greatest idea. Everytime the oven was opened, regardless of whether or not food was even in there yet, the alarm went off, which then led to us waving towels at it and opening the doors and windows to shut it up. I'm sure the neighbours probably didn't appreciate it at 7:30am either.", "All in all, the staff were fabulous, the room was large - the sofa bed was huge by pullout standards - and the facilities were great.

They have ample ski storage area near the main lobby, and allowed us to keep our bikes in storage (keyed access in parking area) on day 2 while we skied.

Perks: its just off the main road as you enter whistler, park out front to check in, unload gear, move to parking right next door, easy breezy. On foot, you have easy access directly to the village walk outside the main lobby and its perfectly central to lifts, shopping, restaurants etc. The only downside for us was that our room was on the village walk side, we wanted to keep the window and door open for cool fresh air and thus had a fair bit of late night walkers noise.

The condo could not be better positioned and was about equal distance from both the base of Blackcomb and Whistler (about a two minute walk). It was also very quiet. A brief outline of the condo \u2013 ground floor had a small kitchen, dining room table and sitting room with one large three seater sofa (folded into a bed if needed) and three easy chairs. It also had a bathroom with a shower (no tub). On the second floor there was a further bathroom with a shower over a tub and three bedrooms \u2013 one queen, one twin and one bunk bedded room. On the third floor was a room with three single beds. Although the condo was not \u2018wow\u2019 it was perfectly comfortable, clean and reasonably well maintained. For a group of friends who are simply into skiing/snowboarding it is perfect but for couples it might not quite so great due to the sleeping arrangements although the single beds could be pushed together if need be. It would be perfect if the rooms had larger beds that could be split if needed to suit all needs. The condo also had a code entry, which eliminated the need for a key, which is great as no need to worry about who carries a key/s and anybody can return to the condo at any time. I wanted to mention the previous reviewer BlackBerryLarry, who was very helpful at answering my questions and also wanted to comment/follow on from his review: the beds were quite comfortable, no feather duvets or 200 thread count sheets but we had no problems and were zonked after a day\u2019s skiing anyway! The lighting was not great and seemed oddly set up as did the TV on the wall \u2013 very small TV with cables hanging down. The bedrooms could have also benefited with some mirrors (the main queen had one but that was it I think). We did not cook in the condo or use the dining room table so I really cannot comment on those things. I must agree with BlackBerryLarry on the lack of Wi Fi; this is easy to set up and something the owners should perhaps consider. We were able to leave out skis etc in the porch area, which was fine although many of us hired lockers at the base of Whistler to save walking in ski boots.

No sink disposal, so we were very careful to use the basket in the sink drain.  it didn't clog at all.  The coffeemaker has NO TIMER, so someone had to wake up every morning and start the coffee.  No crock pot, and the non-stick pans are a little dicey, but otherwise we were fine, since we cook simple things like spaghetti and salad.

We then had plenty of towels for 5 adults and more toilet roll. The repair man removed the mouldy bath caulk and replaced it, the smell was bad but better than looking at nasty black mould in the bath, he couldn't do anything about the shower ceiling as it needs painting and therefore needs to be dry.

Right at the base of Blackcomb.  General call-out for newbies to Whistler...be aware that being at Blackcomb means it's a pain to start your day at Whistler.  You can hop on the Wizard Express, ski down to Whistler Village, then upload from there.  You can take Wizard Express to Solar Coaster to Peak to Peak.  Or you can just walk to Whistler Village.  Due to the amount of time the other two options take (A LOT), we just walked to Whistler Village so that we could be early up the Whistler Gondola on a powder day.

This is not a knock on Le Chamois...just a call out when considering location.  Back to the hotel...", "The building feels very dated.  It felt fresh out of the late 90s with lots of gold trim and very worn carpet and decor.  This carried onto our room (each unit is different so your experience may be different) where the decor and furniture were very dated.    I was there with a buddy to just ski so it didn't bother us too much, but just know you're not getting \"Whistler Mountain luxury.\"  Pool and spa were closed our whole trip.", "Front desk is basic, but has limited hours.  It closes at 11pm and it put a bit of stress on us to get there as we drove after work from Seattle (arrived at 10:30pm).

Le Chamois uses Spicy Sports which has a public entrance and an entrance from the hotel.  After our first day of skiing we walked into an empty shop and we asked both employees where to check our skis (equipment is not allowed in the hotel rooms).  They pointed to a rack that was half full by the door and told us to put them there.  That's it.  No sticker.  No markings.  No tracking.  No claim check.  Then we asked what time they opened and they said 8am.  Knowing that the lifts opened at 8:30am (actually earlier) the next day, that we wanted to walk to Whistler Village, and we wanted to get there early due to a powder day that was going to be unacceptable.  ", "After showering we headed down to Spicy on the way to the village.  We walked in and the two employees were both busy with customers.  Our skis hadn't moved from the rack by the door.  We walked in, grabbed them, and walked out.  No one saw us or questioned us.  Now, I know that theft risk is likely small but they need to give a little consideration for people's personal property.  I was personally skiing on brand new skis/bindings that are actually next year's model.  Sitting unmarked by the door for anyone to grab wasn't cool.  Oddly there were racks of locked ski racks outside the shop, but they didn't have us use them.", "So we grabbed our equipment and walked it down to our car in the parking garage.  We used the car for the next three days to store our skis each night.  Unfortunate but much more convenient and safe than Spicy."]},

We stayed in Apartment 605, the apartment was very generous with 2 bedrooms plus a loft which was huge with only 2 single beds in it.  One bedroom had a comfortable King (I think 2 KS pushed together), bedroom 2 had a Queen bed - not so comfortable. Two bathrooms, full kitchen and there was a washer and dryer in the apartment which was an unexpected bonus.  The outlook was beautiful, on the 6th floor with large windows looking out towards the Four Seasons Hotel (not close) and the mountains beyond.  Very nice clean, white linen, the towels were changed every 4 days.  The place was clean except when we arrived, the filter in the dishwasher had not been cleaned from the previous tenants.  Ski lockers in the basement with a combination lock.  The apartment is tired, and needs freshening up and updating, all the appliances are quite old but everything was in working order, the fridge has a noisy fan which seemed to go alot, it didn't bother us but would some.  The dryer door was held shut by a bit of wood, effective but shabby.  Instructions for the dryer would have been useful, the dial was a bit cryptic but we managed. There was a cupboard under the stairs which had all sorts of odd bits and pieces in it, I felt this space should have been locked if it was the owner's storage area, similarly there was a large television stored in the hall cupboard, that just shouldn't have been there.  Very strange high dining table with high bar style chairs around it.  A picture in the main bedroom had fallen down and was broken behind the chest of drawers, the hook bare on the wall, my husband fixed it and put it back up!", "I HAVE AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE OWNERS OF THIS APARTMENT - ON DAY 4 OUR DAUGHTER HAD A BATH IN THE BATHTUB, PREVIOUSLY ONLY USED FOR SHOWERS, NO WATER WAS SPLASHED OR WENT ON THE FLOOR OF THE BATHROOM BUT DIRECTLY AFTER THE BATH WE NOTICED THE CARPET IN THE DINING ROOM, WAS ABSOLUTELY SOAKED, 4 OF THE LARGE BATHTOWELS AND 4 HANDTOWELS WERE USED TO SOAK UP THE WATER AND THE CARPET WAS STILL WET, THAT IS A SERIOUS AMOUNT OF WATER!  INITIALLY WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE DISHWASHER LEAKING BUT AFTER INVESTIGATION BY MAINTENANCE, WE ALL AGREED THE WATER CAME FROM THE BATHROOM.  MY CONCERN IS THAT MAINTENANCE THOUGHT IT WAS FROM WATER SPLASHED ON THE FLOOR, BUT THERE WASN'T ANY!  THEY WERE GOING TO COME AND RE-DO THE SILASTIC (IT'S OBVIOUS THIS HAS BEEN DONE MANY TIMES PREVIOUSLY) THE SPA JETS MUST BE LEAKING FOR THERE TO BE THAT MUCH WATER!!!  THE CARPET LOOKS FAIRLY NEW BUT IT WILL BE RUINED IF THEY KEEP TRYING TO PATCH THE SILASTIC WHEN THAT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. No-one had a bath for the remainder of our stay which was 10 more days and not surprisingly, no more water problems!", "The Marquise is considered a ski-in/ski-out location which is the case when there is enough snow, from the locker room you can walk out of the building and across the road to a path which you can ski along and then down to the Wizard lift. Conversely, on the way home you just hang a right off the ski slope, ski along the path until you reach the road, click off your skis and walk across the road, BUT only when the snow allows.  The shuttlebus stop is right outside the Marquise and the bus runs every 15 minutes taking you into the Village, I think it runs until about 11:30pm.  The walk to Whistler Village is only about 15 minutes and there are shops and restaurants only a few minutes walk away too.

When we arrived we went to the Aspens which is a different lodge  where we were checked in promptly and without delay.  The customer service was kind and courteous.  We then went to the lodge which was supposed to be a queen bedroom and then a bunk bed.  This was not what we found.  That was not a big deal.  What was quiet frustrating was that upon our arrival we realized there was nothing for luggage except some shopping carts.  This was very inconvenient and frustrating.  Also when we left not even the shopping carts were there.   Other small issues were extremely uncomfortable beds, a completely mis wired vcr/dvd player, a tv with practically no cable channels, and a door that would not close properly without the deadlock.   The final problem was that there was no front desk agents in our lodge and further more the front door was locked and inaccessible which meant we had to go through the parkade every time we wanted to leave or reenter the building.   All these things are usually not something I would complain about but when you are paying that much to stay some where you expect that at the least there will be a front desk agent in the lodge and that there will be luggage carriers.

My friend and I booked a stay in Vancouver and decided to try some of the local areas/ islands before staying in the metropolitan area of  Vancouver so we opted for Whistler.  We knew it was a ski resort but figured we could just enjoy the nature scenery and peaceful off-season of a ski resort.  We were absolutely wrong\u2026 Whistler is a year-round resort area now and we happened to show up during a BMX bike (all good, though).   We checked in on August 18th and the two young women who were working the counter where incredibly nice and helpful.  They asked if we wanted a late checkout (which we did) and gave us some sightseeing and restaurant tips.  Note: This is a timeshare and one of the nice things was that we were not pestered ever to do a timeshare presentation. Throughout our stay the front desk continued to be courteous and helpful.  We had a one-bedroom with a sleeper sofa and a full kitchen.  The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, pans, etc. and had banquet seating which we ended up sitting at more than the sofa to watch TV as well as eat.  Though there was a heat wave occurring the AC worked well and we used it the entire time.  Overall the unit is a comfortable one.  It could use some furnishing/ finish updates but this is a matter of taste and not necessarily something that will impede your experience.  The lodge, however, as a whole needs some updating.  It is an older building that does not shine as bright when compared to the newer resorts that have been built.  It is still a nice place to stay, though.  The biggest plus of this place is the location.  It is situated in Whistler Village while not being in the busy pedestrian areas of the village.  It is a short 3-minute walk to get to the restaurants and shops that bustled with people and noise.  However, the Mountainside Lodge is removed enough from all of that so that when you returned to your suite you did not hear the noise of all the people having a good time in the bars and restaurants late at night.  And, the gondolas that take you to Whistler Peak are a 5-minute walk from the front door of the resort (if you are there to ski then the location of this place is perfect).  We were there for 2 nights and never used our car \u2013 it is a very pedestrian/ bike friendly town.  Overall the Mountainside Resort is a great place to call home while staying in Whistler."]},

Living room/kitchenette was smaller but cosy. It also had another gas fireplace, TV, and the bathroom had a bathtub which was also a spa. Swimming in the heated pool and luxuriating in the spa outdoors with snow falling around you was magical. The staff, without exception, were excellent. Service was professional, prompt and attentive and nothing was too big or too small for them. Housekeeping provided friendly service and were accommodating.

We were curious to see what had changed since then. Answer - not that much, which was a good thing as far as we were concerned, as we had really enjoyed our pre-Olympics visits to Whistler. ", "On our previous trips we stayed at cheaper hotels, which were farther down the village (and thus way further from the lifts), but we remembered how we had worn ourselves out just walking with our equipment to the lifts on those trips, which starts your day off on a sour note. So the idea of staying right next to the lifts sounded very appealing to us, even if we had to pay more for it. We found a good-enough rate and booked the Mountainside, which was certainly not the cheapest option in the Village, but was way cheaper than the nearby \"big boys\". ", "Our first mistake was we dumbly found out, after arriving very late at night and not being able to scope out the location, that we actually took the long route to the lifts the first day, by going out the front entrance and then down through the middle of the village stroll. The trick (which I don't remember reading about on either the Mountainside website, or in any of the reviews we read) is you have to leave the building not by the front doors, but by the \"back door\" -which is the doorway just off of the main desk, that goes to the pool & spa entrance, and then you go out a side metal gate, and walk across the service road through basically a small alley next to another huge hotel, and whoo-hoo, you're right there at the lifts, an honest 5 minute walk at most vs. our 15 minute way-too-long stroll the first day.", "We had booked the least expensive room, which was on the ground floor near the front desk, and were a little taken back at how small it actually was, with a Murphy bed making it even smaller, once you pulled it down. But we found out it was more than adequate for our needs, as we're sure we're simlar to many other skiers/boarders in similar circumstances, as we planned on spendng as little time in the room as necessary, as we'd rather ski all day, and then walk around and enjoy the village experience at night. The Murphy bed was more comfortable than you'd expect (although after being tired from skiing all day, and enjoying the apres ski experience afterwards, no doubt contributed to our falling asleep pretty quickly). We did cook breakfast for ourselves each morning, in the interest of both saving money and saving time in getting to the slopes. The kitchen was supplied enough for the 2 of us, and with a small grocery market (and a Starbucks) literally right across the street (but you go through the front entrance this time, lol), we were good to go.", "The hotel provides you with a padlock and a metal-meshed ski locker on the lowest level (because they don't allow skis in the rooms), which I was a little unsure of before I got there, but it worked out just fine, especially when you realize we would have just been tripping over the skis in our small room anyway. Although there were 2 thermostats on the wall, the only source of heat seemed to be from the one controlling the gas fireplace, which turned out to be a feature we liked, as it was sort of neat to wake up at night and see the gas flames coming from it (being in a ski village and all), and it did keep the room warm enough for us, when we cranked it up a notch. ", "Our only complaints, similar to most of the others we've read, were (1) the walls really are pretty thin, so you can clearly hear the 1am crowd loudly cruising down the street (or the hallway), and on the other end, the 5am traffic noise of the street cleaners /garbage trucks / delivery vehicles (which was really annoying when you really wanted just a couple more hours of undisturbed sleep), and even the noise from your neighbors was very noticeable, if they were also just a little bit loud (which also could range from 6am-ish to way-too-late-ish. (2) The hot water in the shower was pretty skimpy, especially when everybody hit the showers around 4pm. (3) The one small elevator everybody mentions, that you did occasionally have to wait for, as it serves 7 floors, if I remember correctly. (4) You don't get daily maid service, so we used up the soap & towels after the 2nd day, but were then replaced for us on the 3rd day while we were skiing, which saved us having to call Housekeeping when we got back. ski boots (5) The (elevated) gas fireplace heat did not do a good job at drying the inside of our ski boots, and with the Murphy bed, there was really no way to prop the boots near it overnight, as you would with a baseboard heater. ", " ", "We should add too the staff was very friendly and accommodating, from our check in, to our check out experience. Our shuttle didn't leave on our departure day until 3pm, and we didn't want to waste a day not skiing, so we checked out at 8am (normal check out is at 11am), and the staff then checked our bags while we hit the slopes, and then allowed us when we returned at 2pm to use the fitness room to change our clothes and pack our ski luggage in time to catch our shuttle. We did leave them with a nice tip for their being so accomodating, but there were no \"rolling eyes\", sighs, or even any hints we ought to be tipping them - we just got very courteous help, which was a real plus for the Mountainside - thank you front desk staff, we appreciated it ! ", "A couple of \"cheapskate ski tourist\" tips on apres ski, for those like us on a budget ...", "1) Best Happy Hour deal was at the Crystal Palace, which is downstairs off the Village Stroll, and right next to the Old Spaghetti Factory.  We'd get 2 orders of their 30 cent Hot Wings (you order them by the 10's), and a $17 pitcher of Molson beer, which got us started off in a festive mood. Always crowded but friendly, good mix of people, friendly staff. (and a bill of less than $25 CDN). Bravo !", "2) Best dinner value - no contest here - was at \"El Furniture Warehouse\" (no, I am not making this up)  - you'll miss the small wooden sign hanging out front, but you can't miss their big white sandwich board sign that says something like \"All food $4.95\", and the line of people outside in the snow, waiting to get in to this corner-location bar/restaurant. I had to drag the wife in there, due to her reluctance to believe that anything that cheap could be edible in a ski village - but we were both shocked the food WAS pretty darn good, and was a super-good value. There were all kinds of customers enjoying the food, from the young boarders, to families with small kids, to older farts like us. They can do it because, duh, they make their money on the liquor, which was flowing fast and fierce from at least 2 different bars, and although was definitely not 4.95, was still at the lower to mid range  price you'd be paying anywhere else in the Village. There is a fun and active vibe going on as well, along with the obligatory tv screens playing live sports and the usual snowboard hot-dog video highlights, which made it a fun place to be in and a part of. (Just try not to get the booth right next to the door, which is constantly opening and closing due to how busy they are, so it is pretty much like sitting outside !)", "3) \"Cows\" has great ice cream - semi-expensive, but very good, and generous scoops. Get the sundae, which comes in a waffle cup inside a paper cup, with 2 scoops and a topping for $6.", "4) Skip the resort-owned restaurants for lunch if you can, specifically Girabaldi Ski Co in the Main Village at the Gondola, and Dusty's in Creekside - both had pedestrian quality food and were way overpriced for what you got. Pack your own lunch if you can stand to ski with a backpack, or take an extra few minutes off and eat somewhere else in the village."]},

A true perfectionist on every level, the rooms are spotless and the breakfasts which I was personally able to savour were amazing!  Everything home baked and home cooked and if the guest comments that I heard from all around are anything to go on, its the best breakfast they have experienced during their travels in BC.  The guest comments left  are nothing but complimentary and I feel proud enough to write this review and not feel the least bit guilty in encouraging you to visit this lovely gem!

When I found dirty linens in the room, I went to the front desk and asked for new ones to be sent to the room. This apparently was a burden and big ordeal. I've been in hostels to 5 star resorts, and this small quaint, used to be fantastic resort, has dropped significantly.

For example, there were no robes in our room like there have been the last 19 years. There were no extra pillows for the sofa bed or trundle beds. We had to make up the sofa bed ourselves even though the lodge knew we had four people staying in the loft. Small things yes, but they do have an impact.

The delicious hot breakfast was beautifully presented and there was a variety of yummy homemade pastries for the person who had to eat and run. My room was immaculate and furnished with pine furniture, white linens and comforters. The bathroom had a bath and shower combination and there were plenty of hooks to hold all my used towels. Hair dryer, shampoo, hand lotion were all handy. In the room's information binder was detailed restaurant info (price range, noise level, their satisfaction rating, etc.) which I appreciated very much. Chalet Luise has off-street parking and is only a 10 to 15-minute walk into the village. I believe this inn is the closest B&B to the centre and skiing. I had no complaints about Chalet Luise at all.

The resort itself is old but very well maintained and the staff is always friendly and very helpful.  Only two complaints about the resort  the kitchens is very small for cooking and preparing food and the windows definitely need an upgrade.  My son and I kept checking the windows when we first arrived for we thought they were open.  Any noise during the night outside made it hard to sleep for me being a light sleeper.  There was lots of storage space to put everything away and the Jacuzzi tub in the room was definitely well used after a day on the slopes.  The restaurant in the resort though we never visited was always very busy at dinner time so it must be good. There are many choices in the village to eat dinner if cooking at the resort is not your idea of vacation.  All the places we ate at the staff were very friendly.  Yes some nights out were expensive but there are some small places to eat that are very reasonable.

Ruined my 13-day ski vacation."], "content": ["I stayed in Bear Lodge, the blue building, on the second floor overlooking the village stroll in December of 2010. ", "Garfinkle's nightclub was right across the stroll, a stone's throw from my balcony. Forget sleeping! A minimum six nights a week from about 10 p.m. until 2:30 a.m. you are subjected to super-loud club music pumping out of the wide open front door, and large gatherings of young riff-raff screaming, shouting, singing, fighting, hollering, cursing and even fighting, as the hour gets later. If you are serious about skiing and need to get up early to head for the lifts, staying in Bear Lodge will absolutely ruin your vacation, as it did mine. I was actually shocked by the fact the Whistler town council must comprise mostly morons. With their zoning laws, and the fact that the police are not interested in doing anything with these people, it clearly indicates to the public at the large and the tourist spending his hard earned dollars that they are more interested in catering to young riff-raff than the people who are clearly supporting Whistler financially. I seriously doubt that it is the young, obnoxious riff-raff on the street every night who are renting all the pricey condos in Whistler and eating in the high end restaurants of Whistler. I have stayed in many great ski resorts in both Canada and the U.S., and have not experienced any place that is as disgusting as staying on the village stroll in Whistler. In fact, in comparable resorts in the U.S. I have seen signs that made it clear that you had better shut your hole after a certain hour or you'd be hit with a $500 fine. The powers that be in Whistler should be ashamed of themselves for promoting Whistler as a low-grade sewer, rather than a premier, world-class ski resort. ", "I am not lazy, but walking to the lift was pretty far. It took about ten minutes if you really hoofed it, but with all your gear that 10 minutes is painful. I started wearing my shoes to the lifts and carrying my boots and paying for storage for my gear. To make it worse, after your feet are wrecked and killing you from walking back to the condo, you get there and the card keys for the front door do not work! This happened again and again, and there were constantly guests standing around hoping that someone else would come along with a key the worked. Then, in your wrecked feet, you had to walk to a different building where the front desk was to get a new key card, and of course, leave your skis sitting on the sidewalk to be stolen. The desk people kept advising that we should not carry our keys near as credit card or cell phone, but I was doing neither of these things, and neither were some of the other guests that I spoke to. My whole experience in this condo was just a bleeding nightmare. ", "Garbage is far away and hard to find in some kind of underground maze. Also, the front desk had been told to accept my skis from FedEx before I got their. They had a note on my booking, and FedEx was given my unit number and all necessary info; however, when FedEx showed up, apparently the incompetents on the fronts desks said, \"We don't know anyone by that name,\" and my skis went back to Vancouver!", "Some people mention the good points of the condos as being that they have full kitchens and washer and dryer. Yes, they do, but I would hardly call that a \"pro\" point; that is what I paid for, that is what I was told I was getting, and neither of those things are hard to get in Whistler. What was greatly disturbing, and what ruined my vacation were the things I was not told that I was getting: the abominable noise, the dysfunctional key cards, and a walk that is longer than advertised.

If you room overlooks the Executive hotels pool, you will hear kids in the pool all day and all night. They don't enforce the curfew.", "2. Beware of the very thin walls. You can hear everything happening around you, especially in a loft. ", "3. If possible, book the 1 bedroom, even if there's just 2 of you. So much nicer.", "4. The bedding here is like paper mache, everytime you move, you wake up. Or, just drink lots of wine before going to bed and it won't matter :-) ", "5. If you have a loft, bring a sleep mask. There is a skylight in the bedroom loft and it never gets really dark because of street lights. And when it starts getting light outside, the entire unit lights up. But, beware, when you try and put your sleep mask on I'm the am, the paper mache sheets will wake you up. ", "6. If given room 311, ask to move pronto!

We've stayed at the Bear building a few times too.  In summary, these three buildings, known as Deer, Eagle, and Bear, are somewhat no frills, relatively nice, hotels.  The reception for all three is located on the first floor of the Deer building.  There is no pool for any of the buildings.  I'm pretty sure all the rooms have gas burning fireplaces, ensuite washer/dryer, full kitchens, and underground parking available.  We always book through the website alluradirect.com and tend to get great deals.  You are booking directly through the hotel unit owners and are therefore subject to less tax and no Whistler central booking surcharge.  Our room was a second floor studio unit (fine for just the wife and I) with a murphy bed, full kitchen, fireplace, small balcony, and good mountain views.  The rate we paid was $109 CAD / night + 12% taxes.  Not bad at all for a good hotel room in the Whistler Village.  The walk to the Blackcomb Excalibur gondola is about 6-7 minutes.  You can make the walk a little more pleasant by checking your skis down below the Carleton Lodge (right in front of both gondolas) for $5 CAD / night.  I noticed quite a few people commenting about the noise of late night partiers from their rooms of these hotels.  We didn't find that to be a problem really ever and we've stayed at different rooms of the Deer building and Bear building about 6 times now.  As is the case of all hotels in the Whistler Village, you shouldn't be shocked to hear someone being a bit too loud in their room or out on the village stroll for a few seconds.  These units all appear to be privately owned so also keep in mind the quality of the interior furnishings and decorating is not uniform and varies quite a bit.  All things considered, we like these three buildings and will continue to return.  They're 3 star hotels but the price we always get for them compelled me to give them the four star rating for this website."]},

When the nightclubs end there are the usual noises but generally don't last that long and a Snowplough will clear the road in the mornings around 5.30 to 6 pm . Ok I could live with that and booked it.  At 4.03am there was a snowplough outside not JUST clearing the road and driving by which I had imagined BUT it cleared the whole car park and it took 2 hours.  I would defy any heavy sleeper to sleep through the constant scrape of an iron bucket against concrete for 2 hours!! Incidentally with full beam lights coming directly into the apartment.

Meaning each unit is managed by one of seven different property management companies (if you are staying here - make sure you know which managaement property manages your unit, this will save you a migraine when the bus finally gets you up to the village.  When we got to the village we were under the assumpton that we would check in at the front desk like every other hotel in the world, but instead our bus driver had to call 7 different offices to figure out which management company manged our unit).

The vending machines don't work and beep continuously begging for someone to fix them (particularly troublesome considering that is the only option for a drink if you do not want to wait for a bus...).

They charge you $50/hr. to clean the unit upon departure - so you need to make sure everything is clean before departing (by now you should be starting to wonder what you are actually paying for....)", "6.  The office where you check-in/check-out is a 20-minute bus ride followed by a 20-minute walk away from the unit.  (NOTE: in our experience, the check-out time was 10:00AM - so 2 of us navigated our way to the office to drop off the keys while the third guy stayed with the luggage.  Our airport shuttle was to pick us up at the Marquise at 10:30AM.  Before we even made it back to the room from dropping the keys off, housekeeping had showed up to clean the room and the front desk was calling to make sure we were leaving.  This was the only time we heard from the property management company or saw a single employee of the hotel the entire time we were there.  It kinda left me with the impression that they couldn't wait for us to leave.) ", "7.  You are responsible to dispose of all of your own garbage, recycling, and do the dishes.  We did all of this - except we could not find a dumpster anywhere in the unit to dispose of the trash so we left it in an oversized garbage can across the hall in the laundry room.  We went to dinner, came back, and found all of our trash dumped in front of the door with a nasty note pointing us to the dumpster.  Makes me wonder why they didn't just take the trash to the dumpster like any other hospitality company in the world.", "8.  The units are dated and could really use some maintenance.  ", "9.

That is hardly adequate accomodations considering the size of the hotel.

As the Carlton Lodge, which we had already booked and has a free cancellation policy, did not have such facilities, we changed our booking. The price listed in bold type for a similar room for two nights was just a few dollars more.", "There are several things you need to watch very carefully when booking.", "First of all, the location: They list several properties in Whistler and you may not be booked into the only one which actually offers the guest an outdoor pool and hot tub. We were booking into the Deer Lodge which excludes the outdoor pool & hot tub. This is the same for the Eagle & Bear Lodges. As the bookings there are NOT refundable through this site, you may find yourself locked into a booking without the pool you wished.", "The second thing you need to be aware of is the final price you are locked into. Very near the bottom, you will find, in small type, the notation of an added price of a 'ONE TIME CLEANING FEE'. If you are looking at a 2 bedroom unit for two nights, the added $135.00 makes this a very expensive lesson learned. We could have booked the Hilton for 2 nights for $515.00 with only a hotel tax added and free parking. These places are privately owned, we were told, it is a lodge not a hotel, and the parking is an extra $20,00 per night per vehicle. I have let Booking.com know of this misrepresentation to what you expect to pay when you book. In a follow up e-mail confirming the booking, the original price you expected to pay is listed on top in bold type.  In the letter's content, they do list the 'One Time Cleaning Fee', quite a surprise, to say the least.", "The final thing you need to know, and if you miss this one you may well be out the $500.00 damage deposit, make a careful inspection of the entire unit.. ", "Before they hand you the key at the front desk, they will tell you they need your credit card and will place a $500.00 damage deposit on your card. PLEASE, the minute you enter, be vigilant of the damage already there. Think of it similar to renting a car where you are asked to walk around and then note the damage. When you return the car, any damage not listed may be added to your credit card. With our unit in the Deer Lodge, the first thing wrong was the broken mechanism to the patio door's blinds. It lay on a table beside that sliding door. Upon an inspection, we found 3 of the 4 opening windows where bent back at the top and could not be locked, one having the handle torn off. The standing lamp in the living room was broken having exposed 110 volt wires and the shade was missing the knob at the top to secure it. The table lamp in the same room had burn marks on the shade which was turned so a guest did not see it. Both of the cushions to the sofa bed had damage to them and these were turned down. The washing machine had grim & rust marks which seemed to ooze out of the top dispenser with moldy filthy towels still inside. Even the nicely folded white bath towels had black, partly washed out marks on them. Cobwebs were hanging from the ceiling and onto a fancy fireplace light which did not work. Luckily, I took dated pictures and wrote out a list which I handed to the front desk. This is when you are informed another company runs the units and the front desk is not actually the management. It is confusing and I still do not know how these bookings work, what name they are actually under, or who is responsible for what.  I had been given a name to an individual who I contacted several times He refereed everything back to me and the front desk, so it is still a mystery. No reduction to the unit's rental was ever offered. This unit was not fit to be rented out.", "The damage, I would venture to guess (I owned a large detached Whistler chalet for over 30 years), if one were to replace everything noted, would come in at well over $4,000.00, so 'buyer beware' when booking.", "To their credit, with our complaint that we did not have the use of the pool, they cut the cleaning fee in half before we arrived. With the list of the damage, they waived the $20.00 fee per car per night fee, an $80.00 saving. ", "Privately owned units may have different budgets for each unit's up-keep. Many, I am sure, are in excellent shape, but the cleaning fee, considering the standard of cleanliness found, is way too high and the $500.00 damage deposit speaks for itself.", "As it is, staff was very friendly, sympathetic and knowledgeable.

Walking into the unit, it felt like home. Everything is so tidy and organized. There are plenty of movies and dvds available for your entertainment for those nights you want to stay in. Kitchen is well stocked with utensils and cookware. You don't even need to pack much since there is a washer and dryer inside the unit that's all yours. There's an IGA, plenty of restaurants, pharmacy, liquor store right outside your doorstep. It's only a short 10 minute walk to the village. Location is very quiet in the evening, no pub/club and pedestrian noise if you're a light sleeper. Underground parking is a plus, you don't have to worry about parking your car at one of the day lots, that's if you can even find a spot since it's always full.

The second bedroom that was created by expanding a tiny room and reducing the kitchen size is the size of a closet (or jail cell) with no window or ventilation. Not a problem, since one can\u2019t sleep there because the mattress on the bed probably came from a thrift store \u2013 all the springs poke through the top.

We arrived quite late Friday night after a long drive and settled in.  The room was actually very cute and comfortable.  We headed out to grab pizza and brought it back to our room to eat and enjoy some good company.  My girlfriend and I went outside and when we returned we had forgotten our key so we knocked our door (my girlfriend said \"RCMP\"......as a joke..) and we were let in by her hubby.   We then continued to enjoy some light conversation when the hotel receptionist knocked on the door and told us we are going around banging on everyones door and we need to keep it down.  We told him we NEVER knocked on anyones door but our own since we forgot our key.   He left and we continued on with our night of pizza eating.  He returned about 5 minutes later and once again said we are being too rowdy and it's after 10pm and we have to keep it down.  We then invited him in to show him it couldn't be us since we were sitting at the table eating and maybe its coming from someone else room.  He left.... the next morning I was woken up by an early phone call from one of the managers stating he wanted to discuss my behaviour the previous night. He accused us of going up and down the hallway banging on other peoples doors and being very rude and loud.  THEN he actually directly accused me of \"abusing his staff\" to which I then said that i was offended anyone would even accuse me of such a thing. Needless to say it was a rude phone call with nothing but accusations followed by a threat of being evicted.  NOT impressed at all.  So of course when someone accuses me of something i  did not do....I had to further address this.  We were headed out for the day and stopped in to speak with the manager.  When he came out we told him our side and the TRUTH of what really happen the previous night.  The tone from which he was using to address us was so condescending I think it threw all of us for a loop.  He had no intention of hearing us and made his mind up to the point that my hubby called him on his attitude.  By the end of the conversation i shook his hand and thanked him for at least  speaking with us and he apologized for his rude tone in the morning phone call and we carried on with our day.  Needless to say, I have never been spoken to like that before in all my days of travel.  Nor have I ever been threatened to be evicted and I have NEVER in my life been accused of \"abusing\" someone.  I will never return to a place where I am afraid to enjoy a pizza and some good conversation.  I came to get away to relax with no kids and some adult conversation.  This put a huge damper on our little getaway.  I will make sure to tell any family and friends to go to a place where people don't speak down to you and accuse you of things that just didn't happen and I advise anyone else to not come to this hotel.  VERY unprofessional!!!!!  If regular voices are too loud, its time to invest in some good insulation. If you choose to stay here be prepared to not speak after 10pm."]},

The condo is located right in the village close to the Olympic Rings and a five minute walk to the gondolas, and close to restaurants, bars, shopping, and the Marketplace grocery store.  So the location was the biggest positive for this condo.  If you intend on making meals at the condo, I must warn that the kitchen is not well appointed.  Sure the stove works and the kitchen had sufficient cutlery/cooking utensils/plates, but it lacked a skillet (I had to fry scramble eggs on a stick crepe pan), oil, salt and pepper (I bought some for the next visitor), cleaning product like 409 spray, and an adequate supply of trash bags.  The fixtures are also in need of replacement.  The bedroom door knob kept falling off.  Also, the parking spaces for the Eagle Lodge are so tiny that it's tight for trucks and SUV's.

We booked for the family day weekend and our second night at this miserable place and are already trying to find an alternate.  The ENTIRE floor smells like sewer.  ", "Here are the details; we woke up on our first day here to find our kitchen sink full of sewage.  The plumbing had clogged up somewhere in the building and backed up to our sink during the night.  By morning the water drained out leaving behind heaps of sewage.  (all you plumbing experts, I know that the two lines don't mix, but trust me this is nasty nasty stuff) Smelled up the entire unit and we could not even use it.  We didn't pay to stay so we could clean up their mess.  We started calling at 7am and were told someone would come right away to fix it.  At 10:39 after repeated calls, the manager of property management company called to inform me that they only manage a few condos in this unit and they have to work with the strata and were told that someone would be here between 10 - 1030.  Obviously that did not happen.  This while we wasted our morning babysitting the stupid place while waiting for the plumber.  Manager told us we didn't have to we should leave.  As we were leaving a lady showed up with a bottle of windex inquiring about the dirty sink.  First thing she tells us is that this has happened before.  The entire building is prone to backups.  We left while she promised to clean it up.  Interestingly enough as we are walking to our car in the parkade, I notice a man with an auger and various plumbing tools headed to the elevator.  I asked if he was going to our unit, but no such luck.  He was headed to unit 202 for clogged shower stall.  Get my drift here?", "After 3 hours we returned and now the entire corridor smells of sewage.  Our unit in particular.  Sink is clean, but still has crap in it.  Unit stinks.  We called the front desk again and same old run around.  The dishes are dirty,  knives in the wood block have food on them.  None of the drawers in the den work.  Handles come right off.  ", "For what its worth, their check in process, reservation, front desk people are all fine.  People all answer the phone.  Their communication before and during is just fine.  Location is great with everything at your doorstep.  Its quiet.  Parking is awesome.  ", "Trouble is they are incapable of addressing this or any other issue.  Their sole function is to answer the phone call and to direct calls.  They actually don't have any staff capable of handling real issues  Property Management is there to collect money and they are very good at it.  Best part is that when I asked to go speak to someone in person, I was told the lobby which is located in a remote building is not manned on weekends!!!!!.  WTH.  This is hospitality industry that is closed on a weekend?????", "This is a miserable place.  Clearly a very old run down building that needs to be torn down.  But whats worse is that property management is representing these horrible units without any obligation or responsibility.  Their hands are tied by the lousy strata.  Please check the pictures of the sink.  The strata should be taken to court for negligence.  Its a horribly run place.  Update:  We did receive one night refund from the property management company.  I appreciate that.  However, it doesn't make up for the one day lost skiing with my kids because I had to stay at the unit waiting for the plumber."]},

I initially thought I was being clumsy and felt a bit embarrassed. However the next day my husband also almost tripped and I myself as well. We realized that the last step to the door was significantly higher than the others and likely not to building code. It appears an extra slab was put on the top step as a \u201cfix\u201d of some sort, but when walking up a set of stairs you don\u2019t expect changes in height. While I\u2019m young and able enough to not have serious issue, this could easily be a lawsuit waiting to happen for someone else not so lucky. My husband mentioned this to the front desk staff but only got an uncomfortable chuckle as a response.

We researched carefully and were really thrilled with our choice and experiences at Le Chamois, we feel that we got it totally right for us.  We paid for a basic one bedroom apartment/condo, ended up getting one with 2 bathrooms and, unexpectedly, great views up the mountain.  We felt certain we would have ended up with views over the road and forest instead, and would not have complained had that been the case.  The location is amazing, and Upper Village is only 5 or 10 mins walk along the absolutely beautiful Fitzwilliam Trail (lit up with beautiful lights at night) to get into the actual Whistler Village.  I don't understand why some people see a short stroll as an issue, and it was very peaceful staying in Upper Village.  There are several restaurants/cafes/grills/bars in Upper Village.  You also have the regular free bus shuttle during the day, which stops right outside, across the road.  Le Chamois is very nearly ski in/ski out, and its vicinity to the new Whistler Gondola and Magic Chair are very handy.  What an amazingly convenient experience in that regard, and the option of storing your skis overnight in locked racks downstairs at Spicy Sports for free is a brilliant idea.  Our room was mildly tired, the lounge, which was also our daughter's fold out bed, had seen better days but nonetheless, served its purpose just fine.  Our condo had a kitchenette only, but was adequately stocked with the option of an electric frypan, so I didn't really feel that you would miss having hotplates.  The bed in the bedroom was very comfy.  This was a dream holiday for us and not one we could afford to do every year.  But I have little doubt we will be back to stay at Le Chamois again.

Rooms are reasonable sized with a TV, sofa, en suite bathroom and coat area. The bathrooms are appalling though. They are so small that to get in and out of the shower you have to climb round the toilet and I have no idea when they were certainly not cleaned regularly! The only common room is the kitchen which is very traditional and has no atmosphere. I'd definitely not recommend the hostel at all!! The only good thing is that it is right next to Whistler creek side village and of course it is a bed. Not the cheapest bed in whistler however though ..."]},

We were looking for romantic gateway but instead our long weekend was ruined and we tried to stay as much as possible from that scary place. First you need to go to check in to different locations 8-10 min drive. There is no restaurant, bar, housekeeping or concierge whatsoever. We got room 105 which was on the same location as parking and there was no view. The apt smelled terrible (curry/Indian type of food) and we asked to be moved to different apt which they kindly did. They charge for parking each day. If this is a apartment complex one spot should be included right? If you google IronWood they go by 3 star hotel. But we were told that they are condo/apt type of accommodation. We booked through hotel.com and they described them as Fabulous 8.8star. After doing some research you can find very different ranking.  The lowest one was 2.5 star.We travel a lot and so far I trusted hotel.com but after this booking I don\u2019t want to use this website anymore.

Please pay a little bit extra and stay in the village and you can walk and eat and drink as much as you want. Also, the tv in the bedroom never work and the WiFi was very slow so we just switch to data usage. They are asking you to clean the dishes and take your garbage out. $230 a night! No Thank you!!!"]},

They were prompt with all their email responses regarding questions about the property. Checking in was a breeze. You had to go to Creekside which isn't that far away and just park right outside, pop in and out to sign some paperwork and grab the parking pass. Easy peasy. We drove over to the property which was within a building unit with indoor parking. Simple key code and we were in. Each unit is authorized for one parking spot for which you will get a pass for. We got all our stuff out with the help of complimentary luggage carts. The rooms were super spacious and layout was amazing. We were a family of 5 with friends so it definitely made the stay very comfortable. The kitchen had all the amenities to cook, bake and etc. We shopped at Squamish prior to coming up so filled up on groceries and definitely made use of the kitchen. Everyone enjoyed going to the outdoor pool and hot tub and used the rec room to play ping pong. There were hardly any other guests around so made for a nice quiet relaxing stay.As far as location, yes it is a little out of the way and not quite ski in/ski out but the accommodations for the price more than made up for it. If you didn't have a car, the bus stop is right outside the complex down the road. Fare is $2.50Ca each way and short ride to the village. We opted to drive every day and just pay the daily parking rate in the lots for our large group of people which saved more at $10 a day. There isn't any restaurants around as previously mentioned but it's fairly easy to drive or bus over for any needs or to go hangout. Honestly, this property was one of the best experiences we've had coming to Whistler and we absolutely plan on revisiting and staying here again."]},

Luckily, we were able to complete our vacation but it got really weird.  There is no one at the desk in Greystone Lodge since the property is managed by The Aspens, another lodge just around the corner.  We registered at The Aspens but the desk clerks seemed vague about the Greystone.  Once we got our key, we accessed the underground parking lot successfully only to find a completely empty parking garage with no directions for assigned parking.  Luckily, a worker doing carpentry in another area came to our aid and told us to park where we wanted.  The hotel itself has had a rather elegant past but is a bit tired and was eerily empty.  Our room was rather dark and the \"king bed\" was actually two roll aways slid together.  We have visited all fifty states and many foreign countries for over forty-seven years and this was the very worst bed in which we have slept!  When we complained to the desk clerk at The Aspens, she said she would tell the manager who would contact the owner (Room 304!!)  So this is a \"motel\" that sublets rooms much like VRBO or AirB&B but it wasn't clear when we made the reservation.  Perhaps other rooms are better, but it has an odd feeling about the place.

As I like to get a day of skiing in before  the convention, proximity to the mountain and proximity to the convention hotel, Fairmont Chateau Whistler, are key.  The one that best fits those criteria is The Aspens, being the first up the hill from the Fairmont.  Greystone Lodge is the next up the hill from The Aspens.  Besides being the next up the hill, it is also set in a couple of hundred feet from the slope, but still very much ski in and ski out, while The Aspens is right beside the slope.", "The biggest difference between Greystone and The Aspens is that I have never met an owner of a unit at The Aspens.

Also a lot more families around.", "The other thing I noticed was the personal service from the front desk manager, Clint Goyette, who I just now see from the website of the Management Company, Acer Vacation Rentals, is described as a \"partner\".

He also seemed to personally know each of the owners.", "One of the great things about Whistler (unless you are staying at Creekside) is the ability to walk almost anywhere and avoid any interaction with automobiles.

There was a good sized living room with a double height ceiling, a gas fireplace, lots of windows, a covered terrace (not much use in the winter!), a kitchen with a dishwasher and a dining area with dining table that easily seated 6.

I'm sure there are more luxurious places at Whistler, with more services, on-site restaurants, etc., but it is hard to fault this place. It met or exceeded all of our requirements. The information package provided before we arrived was just great...it anticipated all our questions, including where to buy groceries on the way to Whistler, how to order groceries to be delivered to the unit before our arrival, how to buy discounted lift tickets in advance, restaurant recommendations, etc. And while we never needed to contact the \"management\" while we were there since everything worked just fine, there were all sorts of notes around giving contact numbers, urging us to call if there was anything we needed, etc. All in all a great experience.

The trip to get groceries was a bit of a drag as the free shuttles, as good as they are, don't get you near enough the store without transferring to another shuttle. 4 shuttles in total to get to the grocery store is a pain the rear end. In the end we'd hop on the shuttle to get down to the shops then catch a cab with our groceries to get home. It was also faster to walk from the Whistler Village bus stop to Greystone Lodge than catch the bus as the Greystone stop was one of the last stops on its circle route. Faster still was catching the bus at Whistler and hopping off at the first stop (base of Blackcombe) and walking up the ski slope to the lodge. Once we knew the best way to get to and from Whistler Village our location mattered much less to us. The upside to our location was that it was nice and quiet.

The path from the door to the edge of the ski run is about 140-150 paces (YMMV), and most of it has a gentle uphill gradient.

This was in April, and till this day she has not responded to my emails nor my aunt's phone calls. I believe her argument to my aunt was that my uncle (through marriage) had done some flooring for the lodge and still owes her approximately $200.

The second bedroom had a ceiling light that was hanging down and in need of repair.

The hot tub itself is TINY (seats 4 at best) and the whole area is not conducive to socializing at all which was really disappointing because one of the most interesting things to do in Whistler is chat with other visitors. We did not use the pool. When the outdoor hot tub was full one day after skiing, we went to use the indoor hot tub but found it only pool water temperature so we went back outside and squeezed in with several others, some of whom were forced to leave at that point.

I rented 3 condos on the first floor for a week in early March. The lodge was advertised as ski in / ski out with lots of space, amenities and 10 minutes from Whistler village. These were all stretches. First it is NOT ski-in and ski-out. It snowed over 5 feet during our stay but not once were we able to do that. It counts on the Condo association putting snow on the path. Since the condo is about 2200 ft elevation it nearly always rains during the day. This melts the snow and thus maybe with the exception of the coldest months it was a disappointment there. As far as space, they are roomy but the owners have chosen to pack as much bedding in the rooms as possible. Last, its 10 minute walk to the village was greatly exaggerated. You cannot walk down the slopes either too icey or too slushy. there is no path to the bottom of the hill so you are faced with walking down a dirty street or taking the bus, which I found to be the least skier friend of any resort in the past 20 years. Find a cab... forget it and there is no uber. So its a solid 20 minute walk or bus drive in the rain or ice.  As far as the rooms don't rent 107, its the oldest, least equipped of the 3 I rented, blown lights all over it. The sliding door wouldn't even open. The other two 103 and 105 got more positive reviews. The rest of the complex was clean and the pools were well maintained and the lobby was comfortable. Thus 3 stars."]},

The second bedroom had a larger bed, the same roomy dresser and bedside tables.  The second bath had a shower only, and was separate from the bedroom, so slightly less private setup.

I did not want to support a business owner who showed no appreciation for his customers.  I know from experience, from working in customer service for a number of years, that the customer is not always right.  That being said, the customer is sometimes right.  There were clearly a number of people who were not satisfied with their stays at the Chalet, and Mr. Hari, in no way, shape or form, was apologetic.  He responded with arrogance, aggressiveness, and abrasiveness.   He disclosed personal information of his clientele (which actually goes against tripadvisor policy and probably some sort of better business bureau policy).  It is not OK to bash your customers in public, regardless of how justified you feel.  Mr. Hari, you come off in a terrible light in these responses, and I would encourage you to rethink how you respond to your (valuable!) customers in the future.  You are the only reason that I would not recommend this beautiful chalet and the only reason I would not give your accommodations a perfect grade.  Regardless of preconceived notions of the chalet as a result of the distastefulness of the owner, we tried to remain as objective as possible and did truly have pleasant stay."]},

The thing that knocks a star off for me is the lack of clarity about the lodge on its website (unless its changed since we stayed here last month), and more importantly - the management's response to reviews. It has been exaggeration at best, and outright condescending and offensive at worst. Their continual references to less \"mature\" people, failure to acknowledge that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and huge assumptions that just because someone didn't like their breakfast that somehow makes them desiring of a night of debauchery and greasy spoon fare to soak it up in the morning is ridiculous and disrespectful to people who paid money to stay there.

Also, if you want to sit and enjoy the nice leather furniture with a drink in the common area, you will not get the \"quiet\" the management is so fond of referencing. In fact, you will listen to bad plumbing noises coming from the nearby bathroom, loud sounds from a laundry room, and some sort of unidentifiable loud ringing noise. Normally, I wouldn't nitpick about this sort of thing, but if you're going to go on and on and on about how peaceful your chalet is, I am going to clarify the situation from a paying guest's perspective.", "Some other not-so-resort-like qualities included Soft Soap plastic handsoap dispensers and a shampoo dispenser in the shower as opposed to actual products.", "Overall, the bed was comfy, I will say that. The balcony was a nice feature though the only view was of some very nearby trees. The fireplace was nice. They do keep the place clean, so good for them. The service wasn't rude, necessarily, just awkward at times. It was nice to have free parking. And the location is nice, within quick driving distance of the Village. So there are pros to staying here if you're the type that likes being extremely quiet, and going to bed by 11:00. And that's absolutely fine if the chalet wants to cater only to those types, but they need to start being extremely clear about it, and not just on Trip Advisor. I imagine they'll think twice before putting out another Groupon ad, though honestly they should be thankful for the money it brought them instead of constantly insulting the people on here that just want to speak their mind about their experience."]},

But I would rate the Harmony Whistler Rentals only 2 stars, and that's being rather generous.  The Aspens is a \"hotel\" building where every one of the hotel units has been sold; the individual owners are responsible for the maintenance and decor of their unit, while HOA fees cover cleaning and maintenance of the grounds and common areas.  ", "The front desk of the complex merely guides you to the email you will receive from Harmony Whistler Rentals several days before you arrive, and tells you to follow the instructions given there.  Parking is $17/day from a machine in the lobby, and is in a secure underground garage.  ", "Bikes and skis are stored in one large locked cage underground, but outside of the secure garage, and you receive a fob from the front desk to open this if you store your bike there.  We chose to keep our bikes on the secure rack on our vehicle, figuring that was more secure than the cage.  We had no security problems.  ", "Elevators for the complex were frustrating.  There was only one elevator operating in our wing of the building during the 3 nights we stayed, and a 5 minute wait was not uncommon.  During the day, the maid services dominate the one elevator, and the guests either wait or use the stairwells.  ", "There is no air conditioning in this unit, so in the summer, it can get hot.  When we entered the unit at about 6 PM on a day that had been in the 70s (Fahrenheit), the unit was in the high 80s because it had been closed up all day.  There is one small window that opens in the bedroom (about 2 foot square), and only one more in the living room (also 2 foot square).  These are the only windows in the unit that open.  But there is a sliding glass door in the living room that has a screen door, which was a life-saver.  There are two fans supplied as the only cooling means in the unit.  Unfortunately there are 9 halogen lights in this unit, which are huge heat generators -- great for the winter; bad for the summer.  ", "The gas fireplace thermostat was turned off when we got there, yet the fireplace insert was very hot; the metal and the rocks above the fireplace were at about 105 degrees F.  The exhaust output of the fireplace goes through the wall onto the patio, which is enclosed at that point.  There was considerable heat coming from the metal vent pipe; it was too hot to touch.  We took the front glass and the secondary glass off the fireplace to see if we could find the gas shut-off valve, but could not find it.  So I called the Harmony Whistler Vacations' phone number.  Although we had checked in at 6:00 PM (the earliest you can check in is 4:00 PM), their office was closed, and I got an answering service.  The answering service did get ahold of someone from the office who refused to come solve the problem that evening because it \"was not an emergency.\"  They promised to come at 9:00 AM the following morning.  We waited for them in the morning until 10:15 AM (and we never got a courtesy call telling us they would be late).  We finally left the unit with a late start to our vacation day.  We called them on the way out, and they said that they were handling real emergencies at that time, and would get to our unit when they got these solved.  Although we never received a courtesy status call, when we did return to the unit in the late afternoon, the fireplace was cool.  So apparently they did finally send someone out to fix the issue.  Good thing, because the days were warming up.  ", "Unit 231 is on the second floor, with no floor directly above it to create noise.  The unit is, however, directly above the vehicle entrance to the underground garage.  Every time a car drives over the snow grates entering the garage, you hear a \"clank-clank\" from the unit\u2019s bedroom and living room windows (which we had open for ventilation).  And because this unit's windows face the main entrance to The Aspens, you will hear all the noise from people loading and unloading passengers and gear at the entrance, as well as smell all of their smoke drifting into the unit.  We got a lot of marijuana smoke, as well as cigarette smoke in the unit from outside.  The noise continued far into the night.  Many other units face the courtyard or the outside of the building.  If I stayed at The Aspens again, I would opt for one of those units.  ", "The unit is in usable shape, but certainly not pristine.  There is damaged Formica on the extremely small bathroom vanity, and pealing paint.  There is a quirky cold water faucet handle on the one bathroom sink that turns 360 degrees -- you have to get it set just right to turn the cold water off.  The bathroom fan runs continuously -- the wall switch will not turn it off.  The safe in the bedroom closet has instructions for the VRBO renter.  But, according to Harmony Whistler Rentals, it is locked by the owner and unavailable for renters' use.  ", "On the positive side, the king bed was very comfortable; we slept with only a sheet due to the temperature of the unit.  There is a small but well-stocked kitchen with everything you'll need except the food.  There is a pool and hot tub, with complementary guest towels.  There are flat screen TVs in the bedroom and the living room.  There is NO laundry in the unit; it is located in the P2 parking garage 2 floors underground, and costs $5.00 per load.  The washers and dryers are large, but drying cost me an additional $2.50 because it did not dry on the first $2.50.", "The Aspens is located just above Upper Whistler Village, so you can walk to the Village in about 300 yards from the pool area.  Parking in the Village is expensive, so leave your car in the secure garage at The Aspens and walk.  ", "I would not chose to rent this unit again, and would not deal with Harmony Vacation Rentals again for any unit I might rent in Whistler.  They mislead me regarding the timing for the zip line and Peak to Peak package I purchased through them.  I was led to believe that the zip line tour started from the top of the gondola, and would therefore have to be done on the same day as the Peak to Peak ride.  When I spoke to another company's agent in Whistler, I found out that the zip line booking time I had acquired from Harmony made it impossible to do everything in one day.  Harmony Vacation Rentals is simply not helpful to guests unfamiliar with the facility or the village."]},

Having said this, my wife and I found the place a little impersonal compared to some of the other wonderful Canadian B&Bs that we stayed in. For example, although the rooms are luxurious, we felt like we could have been staying in an international hotel chain. In other words, our room (the Maple) didn't have that 'boutique' feel that we are fortunate enough to sometimes find elsewhere.", "Secondly, despite the hosts being very competent in terms of the quality of breakfasts and general advice about the area, again I found the service to be a little impersonal.

They have one stretch room (where they have yoga lessons, I think) a small lunch room with 4 tables, two couches to sit and have your drink (that you can't have in your room) a hot tub outside (the best feature of the hotel) and the steam room, well, that is what they call it, but it is a shower that fits one person and steam comes out the bottom.

The bathtubs also didn't look too clean. The location was fantastic and we had no noise issues so we all slept well. Also had a great view of Blackcomb.

We were there for a week with four adults and 4 kids under 10. Everything we read about this place talked about how close it was and how there was an easy free shuttle to and from the village. This is not true and had we known this we would have definitely rented a car.  The village is good 20 minute walk - 10 of which are to the bus stop. The \"shuttle\" is a actually the regular bus and is ONLY free one way - to the Village, not back. It also comes every 45-minutes to one hour so don't miss it! The only closest grocery store is in the village so if you are planning to purchase a whole bunch of groceries to use in the expansive kitchen that the house has, be prepared to take a taxi to and from the Village. We did this multiple times. Very annoying.  In the past we have stayed at a hotel in the village which we will do again. This place, although very nice and comfortable, would have been just fine if we were there with only adults.

We had a room facing the Village.  At 1am we were awoken by the drunks from The Keg/Brandy's Pub which lasted for two and a half hours.  We ended up calling the police to lodge a noise complaint.  They showed up at around 2:30 when the noise was already dying down.  We called the front desk the next morning to see if we could get switched to a poolside room but they said they were all booked for the next two nights so we weren't able to switch but my husband said well, when someone checks out we could have checked in to a room and they could have been given our room.  I am not sure why that did not occur.  The next two nights were exactly the same deal with the drunks out there yelling and laughing.  I tried calling Brandy's but the phone didn't work properly.  For this reason we will not stay there again.  Now for the other reasons: the place looked like it was clean but upon further inspection, it was dirty - there was dust on the microwave plain as day and there were crumbs in the murphy bed when it was converted to a sofa.  Then this is a good one: they have robes in the room and one robe had a baggie of drugs in it!  That same rob had a sauce stain on it also.  It CLEARLY had not been washed.  Wow.  Another very, very irritating thing is the check in process.  It's at a different place and it's hard to find.  Then when you get there you have no idea where the 'front desk' is as nothing is clearly marked.  It's literally a desk in a small room.  I tried to give the parking pass to the desk downstairs (apparently this is a totally different front desk and only services part of the hotel) but they made me go back to where I checked in.

Location - Execellent In the heart of Whistler near the Whistler chairlift.  Close to restaurants and shops and the general grocery store.  It is 3 1/2 blocks away from IGA.  In order to check in or out you have to walk a block away in order to get service as there is no one at the front desk to serve you or to help.  ", "2. Hotel features - Poor - Parking is expensive at $20/night.  The outdoor pool is warm and fair sized and has room to accommodate lots of people.  There is only 1 elevator which is very slow.  For a 5 story hotel this is insufficient as most people use the stairs - o.k. if you want to get exercise but not convenient when you are carrying heavy items and have to wait a long time for the elevator to arrive.  The hallways are musty and dirty and the drab orange and black trim walls are uninviting and tired-looking.  The ice machine is only located on 3rd floor unlike every other floor from other hotels.  ", "3. Rooms - Good.  We stayed in a loft kitchenette which had a full sized fridge, stove, micro-wave but no in-suite safe.  The loft was a nice feature with a full-sized bathroom and t.v. and queen sized bed that was comfortable.  However the loft was extremely hot for some reason even though it was raining that day.  The pull-out sofa bed was awful.  You could feel the springs while you sleep and gave me a sore back.  The pillows are very poor quality that were standard fill, hard and flat.  The bench style seating area was very nice and fits at least 5 people.  The closet area on the main floor was very small but there was plenty of drawers and a larger closet in the loft was very spacious.  ", "4. Cleanliness - Very Poor.  This is not a place to stay if you are a clean freak.  The bath tubs were never cleaned, the sheets were not changed as they only change them every 3 days.  There were crumbs on the floor that were not swept up, the stove top not cleaned, and the carpet was not vacuumed.  When we complained about the rooms they did nothing about it a their staff left for the day at 4:30PM.  Other hotels we stayed at in other cities were more service oriented and had the front desk people come in to help clean up or repair things after working hours.", "Overall we believe that the poor cleanliness issues, expensive parking and slow elevators are too much of a deterrent to stay here for the price, however the suite itself is nice other than the pull-out bed."]},

It may be a rental unit only rather than an owner-occupied unit, but this is unknown. It is at best a one-star masquerading as something better.  The unit overall is tired, dated, dingy and ill-equipped.  Living room furniture is saggy and worn. No tea, coffee or anything else on check-in. Kitchen amenities the cheapest possible. One example among many: dishes and cutlery are minimal, cheap, mismatched and look as if they were assembled from a variety of downmarket garage sales.  Bedrooms are cramped and the entire unit quite drafty.  The building itself is frame construction and seems poorly-built; while the bed was comfortable, light sleepers will hear every footstep, every toilet flush and every fart from the above and neighboring unit.

Fortunately, both are within easy walking distance of each other. ", "Our room at the Mountain Side Hotel did not look anything like the Executive Inn photos on the website, because all the website photos are interior shots of the 4250 Village Stroll location. Destination travellers should be warned that rooms may not appear as advertised & to confirm their specific hotel address and the immediate amenities on site. Our room was a studio with a murphy bed with apartment sized appliances, air conditioning, gas fire, TV, small jetted tub, & free wireless internet. Our south-facing room overlooked the pool & hot tub area which can be enjoyed by guests staying at either location. The hot water was problematic when showering, switching from scalding to freezing in seconds; prompting me to conclude that it's much better to freeze than burn, but also conclude that they need a plumbing upgrade.

The storage locker diagram both on the door & inside the locker room bears no resemblance to the lockers in the actual room nor do they match the rooms in the hotel (???), in fact, an entire row was missing including the locker that was assigned to us by the front desk (Executive Inn front desk, 4250 Village Stroll, remember!). We randomly chose a locker & used the combination lock provided to us by the front desk, then we let the front desk know that the locker assigned to our unit does not exist; they didn't seem too concerned. Dual location property management, baffling locker room, & rooms which feel like the interior of an RV - it's hokey & unprofessional! ", "The location of both properties is very good for access to the Whistler or Blackcomb village gondolas (<3 minute walk), but would be a 10 minute hike to the Wizard chairlift (The Wizard Chair is often the only upload option for late Spring skiing mid-week, so call the mountain for lift details or visit their website). Driving to both locations is also very convenient via Sundial Place & Village Lane. Active loading & unloading is limited to 15 minutes on the street. For other parking options, check with the front desk or the Whistler Blackcomb website. We parked under the convention center for $5 from 5PM-10AM & drove to Base II on Blackcomb. ", "My two star rating may seem harsh, but here's the deal: you have been sold the idea that Whistler/Blackcomb is a world class destination resort with first-class facilities; you probably have high expectations, and you should, for the price you're paying for both accommodations and lift tickets. Your expectations should be exceeded by the properties you stay in and the on-mountain facilities & terrain. The Executive Inn website is clearly misleading and that's unacceptable in a \"world class\" resort. If your just looking for a reasonable place to spend your ski vacation dollars, then either location of the Executive Inn is fine, but if you want a very modern, full-service, first-class experience, then I suggest you look carefully at other properties.

It was struggling between escaping the '70s whilst trying to be contemporary, only to fail miserably-smacking its fat face on hard wet ground.

{"stars": "3", "hotel": ["Mountain Side Hotel Whistler by Executive"], "title": ["Great location, but won't stay again until they make some changes"], "content": ["My family and I stayed here for a week over the Christmas holiday.  We stayed in two of the 2 level suites (part of Executive Suites, which is located inside of the Mountainside Lodge) - my kids in one suite and my husband and I in the other.  The location couldn't be more ideal and the rooms themselves were spacious and actually quite perfect for us.  Two big problems with the rooms - first, the pillows.  Now, we had a total of 12 pillows between the two rooms and they were all bricks.  Literally like sleeping with your head on a curb.  My husband called down and requested 6 of their softest, fluffiest pillows - they never delivered the pillows so he called again the next morning and they brought up 6 of the exact same pillows.  We can't be the first ones to complain about the pillows - we are not picky people and normally don't complain about these sorts of things but they were ridiculous.  Even my 9 year old daughter was complaining that her neck hurt.  I was actually tempted to go out and buy some pillows since we were going to be there for a week.  I just don't understand why they wouldn't invest in some halfway decent $20 pillows at Target or BB & B - it doesn't take much, we're not talking about a 200, 500 room hotel here. Upon checkout, I mentioned the pillows again and the lady at the front said \"Well, you know it's just so hard because everyone likes different types of pillows.\"  Well, the only people they are clearly catering to are those who like rock hard pillows because they have no other options. Second problem and it was an even bigger issue was the shower situation.   They need to invest in a new water heater.  The water was either scalding scalding hot (and this is coming from someone who likes her jacuzzi at 104 degrees) or freezing cold.  If you were lucky enough to find an okay temp, it would only last for literally 5 seconds and then it would go either completely cold on you or, more often, scalding hot.  We complained about this as well - it was the same for all 4 showers we had between the two rooms.   It's actually a big liability/safety issue - especially for kids.  After the first shower, they only took baths because it was too dangerous for them to shower.  My husband called again and spoke to someone at the front desk about these issues (the  management company which is actually located across the street from the Inn) and asked that a manager call him back when he was in the following day.  We never heard from him.  It's a real bummer we had these two issues because it's such a great location and great price.  Sleep and showers are pretty vital to a long trip so we won't be going back there until we are assured these issues have been addressed."]},

The ski lockers were very convenient and comfortably sized for the family's skis and poles. The foldout bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on, without a single noticeable bulge from underlying supports. The tap water is as good as the best bottled water. The in room WiFi smoothly supported 3 people surfing, streaming, and gaming, and there are plenty of power plugs around. We had a very noisy neighbor the first night and as soon as we reported it to the front desk, they took it very seriously, asked all the right investigative/clarifying questions, and we never heard another peep. The two separate spaces of the common area and the upstairs loft bedroom were just the right amount of privacy without losing the ability to keep an eye on kids. We enjoyed the hot tub and pool, which are very social spots to meet fellow visitors. Rachel at the front desk provided outstanding service, even walking my family partway to a restaurant we were having a hard time finding.", "NEGATIVE: We are not wild about the bifold mirror closet doors.

There were no surprises, either on the positive or negative side.  Our pre-arrival communication with the management company was stellar.  We needed to slightly alter our travel plans by a day due to unforeseen circumstances, and since they had availability on either side they were able to do so seamlessly.  We actually were subtracting a weekend day and adding a weekday (online there was a price savings of a little bit), but we were kept at the same rate.  Not a big deal at all, since they accomodated us easily.  ", "We were driving up early am, skiing, and then checking in.  I stopped at the check in location at around 9am to pick up a temp parking pass, as suggested by the lodging reservations when I made our change.  The kid at check in could not have been more distant.  He didn't want to spend a minute talking to me, even though I was the only person in the lobby.  He gave me the temp parking key and dissapeared before I could ask another question or two.  When we arrived back to check in after skiing (around 3 pm), he was still there and still as unhelpful.  He checked on our room, and said something I've never heard anyone say...  \"Housekeeping is still in there.  The previous guests really left it a mess.  Trashed the place.  It'll be a while.\"  Check in is 4, so I completely understood the possibility of it not being ready an hour prior.  But that was a bit of sharing!  I started to walk out, and another receptionist chased me as I was approaching the door.  She offered to check me in so that I could wait at First Tracks and be handed the key by the concierge on duty when ready.  The first guy could have done this, but he clearly didn't care about customer service or his job.  This was really my only complaint- the front facing employees at Legends check in.  Two male employees who clearly didn't care about customer service.  ", "Anyway, our 2 bedroom was just fine.  Good space, relatively comfortable beds.  I would compare the interior to a nicer Marriott vacation club space.  Nothing fancy, not \"upscale\", but nice quality and comfortable.  Our unit had 27\" tvs.  Who has 27\" tvs in 2017?  That was a bit of a bummer, as we enjoy a movie in the afternoon after skiing and before dinner.  Bathrooms were just so-so.  Lower-grade tray showers with standard glass enclosure that was difficult to close without splashing water outside- very tiny.  Kitchen was good, with the exception of the fact that there was no measuring cup.  ", "Housekeeping was efficient when they came.  Two days they did not show up until close to 4, at which point we were occupying the space and just asked for towels.  One of those days, I asked them to remove towels and she indicated she would do it tomorrow- just leaving us with fresh ones.  A bit strange.  ", "Most of these are a little nitpicky.  This place could be 5 stars.  Location is exceptional to the gondola, and the guts of the units and building are first rate.  I literally did not hear another person the whole vacation, and it was booked solid.  Phenomenally quiet.  If the interior spaces were held to a BIT higher standard, there was more care taken to either training or hiring happier and more engaged staff at Legends, and small details were fixed in the units (tvs, kitchen utensils, etc), I'd be thrilled to stay here often.  As is, it's a nice option.  You won't be blown away, but you'll be comfortable."]},

This was fairly recents anyone going there in the summer or next season should not see any issues.  We did not go to the restaurant as it is a bit pricy and one of our adult children is a vegetarian and it did not have great veggie options - also the restaurant di not have a nice bar/lounge.  that might have been due to the water damage, but we wanted to grab a drink before dinner one night and ended up elsewhere (Whistler has lots of options so it is not that big a deal).  We did, however, go into the ice house to do Vodka tasting in minus 22 degrees that was fun!  Overall I would highly recommend this location, it was a great value and a good location.

The unit's wifi was so bad, I had to call the rental agent again to complain. After being connected to the cable provider, we determined that the owner had installed a second wifi router that was overriding the cable company's main wifi router. Shouldn't have to trouble shoot someone's else's wifi while I am on vacation. The condo instructions provided by Whistler Accommodations were just incorrect with conflicting details throughout. When I emailed the renting agent, she never responded. Eventually I called her on the phone only to be yelled at and told to read the instructions she sent even though that was what was wrong.

For example when we discussed a later checkout or access to a proper bathroom to get changed in - which they said they couldn\u2019t do, although I suspect if they wanted to they could have - there was talk of an extra fee.

I stayed for more than 2 weeks, and the machines were poorly stocked my entire stay; items were overpriced, the machine would take money without dispensing the item, or the buttons simply didn't work (including money return button) so it was just a money donation centre. WiFi offered throughout the hostel was a disaster unfortunately. The splash login screen (that you'll find in almost all HI-Hostels) was a complete nuisance and would pop up continuously.

Location is great since it's quite close to Whistler village (and also very close to Creekside village and gondola). I drive though so I can't say how transit friendly it is. The room and bathroom were nice and clean. Only complaint was that the bed was quite short. Being 6'2\", I could barely fit even diagonally. It would probably even be tight for someone 6' tall. There's a decent amount of storage for a couple bags including lockers (bring your own locks!). There's also a storage room for skis/boards. The common lounge area is pretty nice with a big TV and some movies there. Internet can be hit and miss. I had my data on so didn't really know when WiFi was working or not. So Netflix also doesn't work that well but you'll probably find something in their DVD collection if you want movies. The kitchen is pretty good. Good facilities with enough space. Some of their pots and pans could do with replacing soon though and there's limited supply of some common things like bowls and cutlery. But otherwise it's great for preparing meals. Service at the front desk was quick and easy and the people there were friendly and ready to answer questions. I definitely recommend this place!

Catch it back from #5 bus stop at the Transit Centre; a detail that seemed beyond the comprehension of a lot of people.  You will definitely want to head down as there are no dining options around the Suites and although there are plenty in the village, they get busy quickly.  Several take on-line bookings and I\u2019d suggest doing this early in your trip to ensure decent dining times.

It might not look like you can make it to the Blackcomb Springs, but you can with no trouble. It\u2019s a little-used blue that\u2019s actually pretty good in its own right.  Shady all day and very quiet, it gives a much better return run.

Not even the additional convenience of having a place to do your laundry or being able to store your snowboard, or rent a bike or borrow a go-pro makes it so special. It's more than all these things. What has made us return to the Sundial, time after time, are the people who work there. From Dee at the front desk, to Karen and Sophia who kept our room clean, the twin valets, all of them and all who work to keep the Sundial a \"wonderfully pleasant place\" to stay, they make it the truest reason we always return and always will."]},

It was spring break week so the slopes were busy but the Creekside gondola never seemed to be busy or have long lines. We had a three bedroom unit with bunk beds on one of the bedrooms and we were comfortable with 4 adults and 4 children. The exercise room was sufficient and the pool and hot tub were excellent.

This was the same for our third night too, and still no hot tub lights working.I only got a $30 refund for the issues regarding the hot tub, not really enough to make up for the fact that I only used the hot tub twice for a total time of 10 minutes.Shame, nice hotel but terrible hot tub and I feel I\u2019m out of pocket."]},

Ski rental store (Can Ski) is one minute walking distance. Starbucks is one minute away. The bus to main whistler village stops in front of the hotel main entrance if you don\u2019t want to drive to the main whistler village. You can pick up your lift tickets at the window on the same building if forgot to bring them. Creekside lacks dining options compared to the main Whistler Village. So if you want some variety, you may have to go the main Village for dining. Not a big deal. I\u2019ll say about 5-10 minuets of driving from your underground garage of Legends? Or you can take the bus ($2.50/person/each way). Lots of outside free parking spaces at Main Village in the evening, we found. A few minutes of walk to where all the shops and restaurants are. We couldn\u2019t dine at the Main Village at all because every decent restaurants were completely booked due to the holiday week travelers from US ( Presidents Day week). Some of the top rated restaurants are booked al the way till March!  So, it may be wise to pre book restaurants prior to your arrival if you\u2019re a picky eater. So we ended up eating at some tocos place and Dusty\u2019s(next to the hotel). It was ok. Food is food. We\u2019re all pretty tire from all day of skiing so it really didn\u2019t make a huge difference, thank God. One quick note, there\u2019s a pizza place in Creekside that was recommended by all the staffs in hotel and also had a good online reviews.  Well, if you are from the NYC areas like us with constant exposure to some best pizzas in the world, you will be disappointed. My 8 y.o. has never said \u201cNo\u201d to pizza yet. She said \u201cNo\u201d very politely to second night of possible pizza dinner.  By the way, there\u2019s no restaurants within the hotel.

No, the balcony doesn\u2019t come with heating. You\u2019ll need a nice brandy to warm you up while smoking. The kitchen is fully stocked with all the utensils and equipments(?) for you to cook to feed your family, if you wishes. There\u2019s a small grocery store in Creekside, I heard. But I know for sure that there a big supermarket in the Main Whistler Village.  Ski lockers are located inside on the first floor of the hotel and has convenient access to gondola. ", "One thing about skiing out of Creekside Gondola, retuning back to the base, there is no Green(beginner\u2019s) slopes but only Blue(intermediate) slopes. If one of your party is a beginner skier, it may be little tough. He or she may have to take the Gondola down to the base, although I\u2019m not certain whether that\u2019s allowed  or not.  The intermediate slopes here are not the same as intermediate slopes in East Coast US ski mountains :)", "If you\u2019re coming to Whistler for skiing, Legends is a great option for staying.

Legends was an exceptional property, and with the Peak to Peak gondola that only takes 12 minutes, you can easily ski to Blackcomb and back to Whistler in a day.

It is a few miles outside of the Whistler Village so if you want to be able to walk to the Village and the gondola it won't work but for skiing there is a chairlift right out the back of Legends.  We were there for downhill biking so had to drive to the village and park, but worked out find since we rented bikes there anyway."]},

Bathrooms were a good size and we appreciated having laundry in the suite. ", "The amenities are excellent - beautiful pool, hot tub for adults only and another one for everyone. The games room was great - pool table (although the cues needed new tips), video games room, etc. ", "I appreciated how quiet the rooms were and the location just far enough from the noise of the village, but close enough that we could catch a bus just steps from the front door, straight into the village when we wanted to. One evening we were in the village late after the lumina experience, and my kids were taken aback by the crowds of screaming drunk 20somethings swearing and staggering around the streets during a pub crawl. I then realized how fortunate we were to be staying out of the chaos. However, if you have lots of village centred  activities, you may prefer a hotel right in the village in order to avoid the 15 minute or so commute in. There is s little collection of shops across the street from Legends which included a well stocked grocery store, liquor store and Starbucks.  My one complaint with legends is with the front desk staff. They were either incompetent or just rude. They didn\u2019t seem to have usual front desk pleasantries which I found I missed. No \u201chow was your trip\u201d or \u201cI apologize but your room isn\u2019t ready\u201d or \u201cthe elevator is that way\u201d. Clearly they haven\u2019t taken pride in hospitality - it felt like they were running a cheap hostel. For example, there were zero luggage racks to be found and they didn\u2019t seem to care. When I real in the hotel guide that we could request one to be brought to the room for check out, the person answering the phone didn\u2019t even attempt a fake apology, it was just \u201cwe don\u2019t have anybody to do that.\u201d When given my room key, it was just \u201chere\u2019s your room.\u201d Without any direction as to where that actually was. When we arrived and the room wasn\u2019t ready they told us we could wait by the pool and phone the front desk periodically to see if it was ready as they don\u2019t call guests. When I asked what the number was, the front desk person didn\u2019t know it and told me to look on the hotel phone. These are several examples but we just avoided front desk as much as possible because everything else about the hotel was so fantastic. It\u2019s not a deal breaker but it was surprising and a little irritating. Hopefully management teaches them some very fundamental customer service skills."]},

Everything was comfortable, ultra clean, and in good repair. The beds were some of the best we have experienced, the linens of a high thread count and bathroom amenities worthy of a high standard. The air conditioning needs to be noted, it was extremely quiet! Not the noisy window units that keep one up at night.

The bus to the village was free over the weekend but parking is quite inexpensive in the village day lots just for convenience.", "The Legends amenities were great. The billiards table, the BBQ and pool area were in high demand over the beautiful July weekend. It was delightful to soak in the hot tub after the grueling hikes up the Chief and the black diamond hikes on top of Whistler mountain. One downside, during the afternoon, the pool was full to bursting with kids and pool toys, that there was no space for other swimmers. Regardless, the tinkle of kids laughter was enjoyable.

With a family this size, we are budget minded, so I look for the most bang for the buck.", "If you stayed at First Tracks before like we did, Legends is going to be noisier in general - more kids and families.  Our 3 bedroom faced the mountain, the pool and backed up to the side of Dusty\u2019s BBQ, so we heard kids playing in the pool all the time.  On Wednesday nights and the weekends, Dusty\u2019s has live music that can be heard within the unit - come with some expectations that you are not going to have the quiet of a condo mid-mountain. Though Creekside is quieter than the village, in the three years since we\u2019ve last been here, it\u2019s growing up.  There is a lot more here than before, and with that is more traffic. ", "The noise usually subsided at the latest by 11:30pm.  ", "The 3 bedroom was sufficient in size for our family.  We are big people (we have one 6\u20197\u2019\u2019 college-aged son and another soon to be college football player, for instance) and never felt cramped.  Beds were comfortable - 1 king, a double/twin bunk, two twins and a pull out couch - 7 beds total. Two large bathrooms were great too.", "The kitchen allowed us to cook most of our meals, thanks to a full-sized oven and refrigerator.  (Thank you Costco in Vancouver for feeding this family inexpensively). The Creekside market across the street was super convienient for grabbing last minute necessities, though it is pricey when buying fresh food (meat, dairy, etc.) Other items are more reasonable. A dining table with seating for 8 was great for family meals.", "We stored our ski equipment in the provided lockers downstairs (bring an extra combo lock if you need more than one locker - Legends only provides one), and it took us all of 2 minutes to walk to the gondola. The gondola and then the Big Red chair get you to anywhere on either mountain - though to get back to Creekside base, you\u2019ll need to be a solid blue run skier or else you will need to download on the gondola to get back - which is not a big deal for little kids.", "Housekeeping was hit or miss.  One day towels were replenished and beds made, but everything else was left.  Another day, one housekeeper spent an hour scouring the place. Seems consistent with other reviews.

Icy on top, decent mid mountain and slushy lower.  Truly variable - It will force you to be better.  We enjoyed skiing in December/January better, but all in all not bad in late March.

Because we had a bill on our table, nobody came back to our table to assist us with drinks, coffee, etc. during our meal.  The food was disappointing, very dry waffles and pancakes, no more large plates available during more than 30 minutes.  I felt that I could receive a much better experience (food and service) elsewhere in Whislter.  Fortunately, Terrence came at our table at the end of our meal and tried to save the experience by bringing some tea.

Although there is a car valet stand, and several guys standing there, no one came over to help us, or greet us.  It was a strange welcome.  Finally after asking, we received help with our bags and someone to park our car.   The positive this stay was the lovely housekeeper who cleaned our room and always smiled and greeted us, and the great waitress in the bar.

The swimming pool has no sun loungers as shown in photos prior to booking and was very crowded. I would not recommend this room to any family as it's tiny and we will not book here again.

As promised, it was ready right at 4:00PM and when we arrived in the room, it was exactly what we booked with a beautiful mountain view and our luggage was already in the room when we arrived.

She ensured we got into our room without problems, kept tabs on our experiences at the hotel, and kept us engaged with all the activities that were going on in the property. My kids especially enjoyed the s\u2019more making experience with complimentary hot cocoa and cups of chili. Breakfast was amazing! The staff always escorted us with a smile. By the second day, the restaurant staff greeted us by name. I thought that was a nice touch. Food is always fresh and hearty enough for the rest of our adventure on the slopes. Location was fantastic! Most families with young kids dread the morning walk to the slopes with all the equipment. Westin Whistler was within 3 minutes walk to the slopes. The whole family appreciated the proximity. You really can\u2019t go wrong with the location. We especially appreciated the ski equipment valet service in the afternoon. You can literally come down the slopes and leave the ski equipment right at the base and head over to the room. It really made a difference after a long day of skiing. We have to compliment Lisa again for her foresight when she informed us about all the services and amenities on site that we can take advantage of.

I stayed in a Superior King which is a great option for couples and had a vaulted ceiling unlike the Deluxe King (worth the upgrade to the Superior in my opinion). Super comfortable bed, big flat screen TV, clean room and bathroom with nice toiletries. The gym, though small, was nicely air conditioned and great for my morning workout and had all the equipment I needed. Enjoyed the pool and hot tub afterwards - I like how it opened at 7AM so I was able to enjoy the sunrise and serenity while everyone else slept. The customer service at the Aava is top notch - extremely friendly and helpful. They offer free GoPro rentals which is a unique perk and are extremely bike friendly with tools and even a power wash station out front to clean your bike off. I could agree with other reviewers that the rooms are starting to show their age, but they've just recently redone the lobby (which looks cool and modern!) and apparently the rooms are next on the list which is exciting!

It does have a small but complete kitchen with stove, oven, dishwasher, microwave, fridge and utensils so you can be self sufficient and there are a couple of good supermarkets in town.  This is good because Whistler eating can be crowded and expensive.

Shortly after we checked in, a bottle of wine and card were delivered to our room as a gift to mark our 10-year anniversary. What a thoughtful gesture! We stayed in a 2-bedroom suite on the 9th floor and we liked how it came with a kitchenette. The patio/ balcony was a good size, boasting beautiful views of the mountains and village. We were able to get ski fittings done in the room (so convenient and efficient!) and we were ready for the slopes within an hour of arriving. The lifts are literally a 2-minute walk away! And you can drop off your rental equipment right at the hotel. At around 3pm, they would have hot chocolate and s\u2019mores waiting for the kids (and adults!) who were returning from lessons. They also ran movies and kids activities all day- in case some kids wanted to a break from the outdoors. My kids loved making gingerbread cookies after a morning on the slopes. The village is only steps away so you can easily grab something to eat, shop and walk around. Great, convenient location! Why I didn\u2019t give the hotel 5 stars was because we found a brown stain on one of the toilets upon arrival. It didn\u2019t ruin the vacation for us and we were in such an excited hurry to get on the slopes that we were generally unfazed (or at least not as bothered as we could have been).

I tried calling front desk to speak to a manager but no one answered, so I went downstairs and ask the same employee Maverick who was standing at the front desk who is his manager? He told me that he was the only one there and he was going to call the police. I said fine but told him don't ever tell me to shut the f up and I want to talk to a manager. The police came and told us we had to leave because it's a business and they have the right to refuse service.

That said it is only a simple 3 minute walk into the centre and about 10 minutes to the Ski Lifts (even in ski boots!). The Hotel has the look of what I always imagined a North American Ski Hotel to look like - low rise, set in its own grounds with trees (Beautifully lit up for Christmas). To my eyes it contrasted favourably with the somewhat Transylvanian Mock Gothic style of architecture of most of the other hotels in Whistler. Having read some other reviews we asked for a quiet room at the end of a corridor and were given a pleasant top floor room where the vaulted ceiling gave a good sense of space. Great views across the adjoining Golf Range to the mountains and slopes beyond. We didn't hear any other neighbours apart from an occasional dog barking next door for one night. Very large screen television with multiple channels. Coffee machine and Kettle with a Fridge to keep milk etc in. Bathroom was relatively small and we would have preferred the option of a bath to soak in, rather than just a shower. There is a small outdoor Hot Tub and a small swimming pool with one of those flame pit things to sit around if you wish. No public rooms as such just a very elongated lobby area. Individual steel lockers to lock your skis in are available in the basement (where Black Tie have a ski rental outlet). You can hand your boots in at Reception for overnight drying if you wish. Staff unfailingly helpful and pleasant. High turnover of guests staying only a night or two did make it seem like a Motel at times rather than a holiday hotel. Our only real grumble was with the breakfast. If you choose to have it you receive a voucher to hand to the contract caterers operating in the building called the CABN across the drive from the main Hotel entrance. It is a very basic buffet breakfast with no variety whatsoever so after only a couple of days you start to feel it is poor value. Is a Hotel that doesn't do its own breakfasts within the hotel itself a real Hotel? However if we hadn't chosen breakfast as part of our package we wouldn't have been able to comment. Entire Hotel is non smoking which was good."]},

The room we purchased, is in fact, in the top 10% of the most expensive rooms in all of Whistler Village, this includes all Hotels.

Split beds are terribly uncomfortable because there is a large dip where both beds meet.  This information is nowhere to be found on the website, via national reservations or even stated when physically checking into the Suite,  even though all your staff knew about it. The advertisement of a \"King\" bed is false and misleading.  My expectation at $440.00 per night is a \"Complete\" king bed, not 2 beds pushed together.  If i were staying at the lodge in Squamish, my expectation would be uncomfortable beds, pushed together.  Another oversight of your front desk staff, they kept stating to me on check-out \"You should have told us earlier and you could have moved rooms\".

Also, they (like many hotels), fail hard when it comes to power socket locations. There are none by the bed so you have to charge all devices somewhere else in the room, which really annoys me as it's such a simple thing that causes unnecessary inconvenience. We also found the walls a little thin. When people walked past or the cleaners were outside, you could hear it all very clearly. Having a territorial dog, he didn't take kindly to this and often began growling at the door as a result.", "The WiFi here is great, works well even when streaming Netflix on your device.

When I checked in I asked for a room on a higher floor but they said they couldn\u2019t do it. I like the convenience of the Hilton; walk out to the gondola and attached ski rental shop (Summit Ski). But I paid a 5 star price for a 3.5 star place. I did have a nice massage in the Indonesian Spa that sits near the sauna.  I would stay here again; if the price was 50% less. "]},

Booked a room on hotels.com that stated it accommodated 4 people. We booked for two people because we weren't 100% sure the other 2 guests would be coming or not. No where on the website or reservation did it state we would be charged more if the full amount of people came. Upon getting to the hotel to check in we were informed that we needed to pay more because we had 2 more guests with us. They said we needed to pay $60 extra each night we were staying, totaling to an addition of $180. We let the staff know that it was no where on the booking page and expressed our confusion because the hotel room states it fits 4 people. The lady at the front desk, Ivette, specifically told us if we had changed the number of people to 4 only 48hrs before check in we wouldn't be getting charged. She was incredibly rude and harsh the entire time we spoke with her and showed zero understanding as to why this didn't make sense. We asked to speak to a manager and she informed us that they had no manager on duty until 11pm (7 hrs later). After questioning how they operate with no supervisor on duty or on call for that long she changed her mind and said she would look for the manager they all of a sudden had working. We waited in the lobby with all of our bags for an hour and a half. On several occasions while talking to Ivette she would walk to the back room mid-sentence and we could hear her back there consulting with some apparent figure of authority that never came to the front desk to speak for themselves. Over the course of that time she went back and forth on whether a manager was coming or not. We also called hotels.com and the supervisor there stated that it is the hotels fault for not stating that extra charge policy on their agreement with hotels.com. They offered us a rebate for hotels.com and apologized for the hotels lack of clarity. At one point Ivette came out and stated that they could refund us for our entire stay. So they couldn't wave the $180 fee we wouldn't have paid if we booked it for four 48 hours earlier, but they could refund us $550 and leave us with no place to stay; didn't make any sense. I asked if I could speak with the manager who gave us that option and she said she'd go find him. She left, came back and was standing at the front desk for about 10 minutes. I went up and asked if the manager was coming and she just looked at me and said, \"Oh, I couldn't find him.\" We eventually checked in and paid the fee just so we could stop being thrown for a loop in the lobby and continue on with our evening. We were told management would call at 11pm, and then again at 7pm the next day, they never called. It took two days to have any contact from a manager after repeatedly checking in at front desk. The manager who met with us apologized and simply said there was absolutely nothing she could do and she had no way to refund it. In regards to Ivette, she specifically said, \"I know her Russian accent can come off harsh so I'm sorry for that\", and blamed her Russian accent for the rude behavior. We had mentioned nothing about her accent and simply had said she demonstrated poor customer service, so this seemed highly unprofessional to discriminate against her in this way. It took calmly explaining the situation to the manager for 10 minutes for her to check with some person they continued to check with in the back, and offer us $60 off. She rudely and shortly asked if we were satisfied. We mentioned that it was just frustrating to deal with horrible customer service, being given back and forth information on charges and presence of a manager, waiting in the lobby for an hour and a half on the basis that a manager was coming, not being contacted for two days despite being told we would and all the rest and she still couldn't wave the fee. She simply said, take it or leave it. We decided to drop it because clearly this hotel is incapable of providing adequate customer service and their policies/management are all over the place.

They were a bunch of younger guys and woke us up multiple times after they returned from the bar. Whistler is a party destination so this is a very common thing to come across in this town at hotels. ", "I used to live in town and worked at another local hotel at front desk so can confirm that the Avva totally mishandled the situation. We lodged three complaints with the front desk before we eventually gave up. ", "The hotel claimed they were fully booked and therefore could not move us into a different standard room with the one exception that they had some suites left but they would not move us to one of them unless we paid them more money.", " All other hotels were now out of our budget for the weekend so we were forced to stay and not able to relax or enjoy our stay without having to listen to the bros next door at all hours of the day and night. We were even told that they receive complaints about noise transfer in these type of rooms all the time and that the hotel isn't properly insulated and has been that way since they built it. We were not even offered any discounts for our trouble in lieu of the management being unable to move us to another room or even let us stay in the upgraded suite for free which would have been standard practice in such a situation. An offer of a 50% discount for the stay or even free parking would have gone a long way. ", "We left like the hotel simply didn't care that much and got the impression that they dealt with this type of complaint all the time. They boys next door were certainly being above average in volume but at the same time they were not having a major party in their room so the only solution provided was for the hotel to call the police on them if the partying got out of control. A large portion of the time they were just speaking at a fairly normal level for a group of men so kicking them out would have been unfair to them too as they were just a bunch of guys talking in their room. At one point, one drunkenly tried to get in through the shared locked door but then gave up when he discovered it was locked. Not the greatest experience to have happen at 2 am. Luckily we were already awake due to the noise they made after the bar.", " The front desk staff were nice enough but had no real solution and seemed totally powerless to help solve our problem which was totally dissatisfying and we felt like we were just going around in circles with no options but just to stay and deal with it. The manager was borderline rude and unhelpful as well. If their hotel has a chronic issue with noise insulation, then they should be prepared to move the guest asap- even if only the suites are left. If that fails then they should be reimbursing guests for at least a portion of their stay as is standard practice.", "Further reading of reviews for the Aava Hotel on Trip Advisor shows that the sound issue is an ongoing theme and major complaint among past guests. The hotel will surely leave a rebuttal as they have to all poor reviews giving the run around to make it seem like they did everything they could etc but this simply is not the case. ", "Bottom line, the Avva Hotel's main issue is sound proofing between the rooms which they are fully aware of but fail to have a system to address it when the hotel is busy. Combined with the lack of action taken by staff that could have easily remedied the situation or at least made it more tolerable by offering some some of compensation resulted in an overall poor experience."]},

When my husband and I decided to do a weekend getaway at Whistler it seemed only natural to book at the delta whistler village.   Although it was a nice facility, I would rate this far below my average Marriott experience due to the following issues. First, I booked a mountain view one bedroom with fireplace and balcony. When I checked in I was thanked for my loyalty and advised I was upgraded to a mountain view one bedroom suite with a fireplace and balcony.  Huh?  That\u2019s what I booked but ok, thanks....   secondly, when I booked the room through the Marriott app it noted the lobby had some construction going on that would not affect room stays. That was no problem, however, when we arrived we found out the gym was also closed. Now this may seem like a stupid thing to a lot of people, but my husband and I really enjoy a workout when we are away, and so I was really disappointed to find this closed.  After going back into the app, under the facility services, I found a small note regarding the gym being closed, but it was not posted as obviously as the lobby renovations.  I should also note that they offered us to use the gym at a close by hotel, except it didn\u2019t open til 10am.  So forget a morning workout before starting your day....  finally, and probably the most disappointing aspect was the ridiculous noise factor.  So our \u2018upgraded\u2019 room faced the village, which seemed really great at first, but after returning to our room around 10pm from dinner I noticed the sound of dance bass pumping out into the village from the restaurant across the street (or maybe it was the night club, hard to tell). So I\u2019m not that old, and was totally cool with it thinking they would stop blasting at around 11 or 12 and that would be fine. At 1 am, when it was still going I was seriously ready to check out to another hotel, and by 2am, well, needless to say, I had decided I would never stay at that hotel again.  Perhaps I sound like a party pooper, but ultimately I just don\u2019t think the hotel should accept that noise factor past 11 or 12 for those guest who want a little sleep or are traveling with kids. All in all, the facility is nice, guest services were good, but I will never stay there again due to the noise issue!"]},

The swimming pool and hot tubs were great and every afternoon over festive season they had hot chocolate and lovely treats for the kids in the lobby. A nice touch after skiing all day. The kids loved it!", "The shuttle service is very regular and takes you straight to the Gondolas. We actually walked a few times as it is only about a 10minute walk from the hotel to the gondola. You can use a ski storage area for free, right by the gondola to save you carrying your skis/poles. ", "The only negative point really was the noise! We had room 1322/24 and it over looks the main street. Also the hotel is situated next to a noisy night club, and it was sooo noisy every single night between 11-2ish!  Also the vehicle clearing the snow from the village starts around 5:30-6am and the snow dumping round is right next to the hotel, so the noise was rediculous! So even though the beds were super comfy, we all had very poor sleep as woken constantly!", "We had one small incident with house keeping scooping up my daughter's two teddies (which she has had since birth!) in with the bedding and taken away! Daughter is pretty devastated as so far they have not been found! I am hoping the wonderful service from the hotel staff will find them!"]},

There's minimal walk from hotel to access Blackcomb mountain. The ski locker provided is also convenient, but quite the small. There is a pub on the ground floor when you crave for draft after hitting slope. And there are two hot tubs. The house keeping did a decent job each day in tidying up the room and resupply toiletry and coffee supply. ", "Now there are lots issues that disappoints our stay. When we first arrived, two of the front desk staff was assisting checking in another couple already, while the other one never once made eye contact or offer to help us. After standing around for 8 minutes, a young lady finally came up to us ask if we need assistance and helped us check in with the kiosk desk across from the front desk. Despite having multiple large luggages and ski/board bag, no one ever offer assistance to bring luggages up to our room or at least offer luggages cart. Front desk staffs in generally seems miserable and do not want to be there, for the next 8 days and nights, day in and day out, front desk staffs always avoid eye contacts from passing guests, not once were we ever greeted nor asked about our stay. I can't exactly say service at the hotel is bad, it's simply non-existence, no service or what so ever, not even friendly smile or greeting. You don't feel welcomed while staying there.", "As a GHA Discovery member, I've had really good experience with other GHA brands in the past. Despite booked directly with the hotel and being a a Discovery program member, there's no aknowldgement, none of the Discovery member perks were offered, which is a huge disappointment. We had room change on the third day, the late check was not offered as Discovery member benefit, we were still required to checkout the room before our new room is available. Most other hotel chain give loyalty member and booking direct better room choices, although we booked directly with hotel 10 months in advance, we were placed the worst room for mountain view studio category, while our friend booked 4 months after us through third party online travel site received a much better room in the same category. I would recommend against booking with the hotel directly. ", "The overall building layout consists of two wings, one with mountain view, the other wings really is a Charleton lodge view. You need to stand right next to the window and look to the side very hard to see the mountain. So basically only half of the mountain view rooms are truly mountain view, the other half are side mountain view if you look hard enough. We have room on the third floor, which have zero privacy. People from pool/hot tubs area can see directly into the room. And people do stay at pool/tubs area until late hours. Basically all 'mountain view' rooms on floor 3-5 have no privacy. Only floor 6 & 7 have privacy, people can't see into the room. Floor 8 do have privacy, but it only exists in the wing without direct mountain view. And floor 3 is very close to the pub. We brought up noise concern and were offered to move to Pan Pacific Village Center in lower floor with no view, it's very much an insult when you paid for view.", "Our studio rooms were quite small, there was no room for luggages, when the bed pull down as many other reviewers noted. And the murphy bed was okay, its not the same as an actaul bed. This is the first time I ever slept on a murphy bed, I would say its an interesting experience. For one or two nights maybe ok, a week is definitely too much for my back. The room temperature is constant, there's no way to coo down the room despite the temperature control. And the wall is thin, sounds insulation is very poor. We can hear the ski boots from people upstair, the vibration when they ran dishwasher, the noise from hall way. ", "There were two young rowdy guests at the hotel the second weekend we were there, they invited a group of their friends to the hotel using hot tubs, since hotel doesn't control access. Despite the we were in the tub already and the maximum occupancy for smaller tub is 6, their group joined in exceeding the limit. And they were very loud at the pool area late at night, just yelling at each other. Its impossible to sleep. Any hotel would have rowdy guests, and this hotel's layout make is far more bother some to be affected. ", "The pub Duhb Lin Gate on the ground plays loud music, all  mountain view room would hear the music to some degree. The ski locker is convenient, but very small, barely enough for two skis/board, not big enough for boots or anything else. There are public access through the hotel ground all the time. ", "The only staffs that seems to made any efforts were the cleaning staffs. They were not perfect, there was day when we return and the room still not serviced, and day where it was service but none of the supply were replenish. But they do their best to work around each different room's schedule, and its hard guests are out at different times.", "The facility at Pan Pacific Mountainside is more like a 3 star serviced apartments, but the overall experience is 2.5 stars. I would recommend Pan Pacific Mountainside for young guests who do not plan to sleep but to be out late at night, since it does provide a central location for night life. And people who not need privacy. But if you do want mountain view (there are only 6 rooms have decent mountain view and privacy in the same time), and want good night sleep, this property would most likely fail to deliver. There are three other hotel with equally good location, Sundial Boutique, Carleton Lodge & Westin. We truly enjoy Whistler, but I highly doubt we will return to Pan Pacific Mountainside."]},

Close to all the shops and restaurants for me and the wife. Eating out all the time eventually can be a bit much so I appreciate having the in unit kitchen. All the units we've been in are suites and have a nice little living room and dining table for when we feel lazy and just want to lounge about. Being the cook in the family i enjoy getting a break thanks to the buffet breakfast, which is much better now that the renovations are done. hint: there are enough sandwich fixings for a good brown bag lunch for the ski hill too. Not only is this a huge time save, but saves considerable $$ as well. Sitting down anywhere in this town with a family of 4 is pretty expensive, unless you are just after pizza. A new bar/tapas place seems to have taken over the old lounge, so the apres is both longer and has better options.", "We also find the building surprisingly quiet. the last stay our room faced the fire station. luckily, if a fire truck had left we never noticed. we also had a clear view of Garf's night club, but were never woken by any late night noise. the noise is always one of our biggest concerns when booking in the village, but its never been an issue in this building."]},

It seems that so few rooms have adequate storage space, but not the case here.  Staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful and friendly.  The breakfast included in the stay was just right to get set up for a day of skiing with a range of items from cereals to fruit, bagels, toast or croissant, eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese, cold cuts and more. Other amenities included an outdoor heated pool and hot tub, a small gym and spa, and a shuttle service that will take you anywhere within 5 kilometers.  We found the location to be ideal as it was at one end of Whistler Village away from the fray but included a locker at sister hotel the Pan Pacific Mountainside, a two-minute walk which is immediately adjacent to the Excalibur gondola.

Check in was a breeze, and the receptionist was so kind and friendly. Upon getting to the room, it is so cute, and most importantly cleaned. I always have to check the beds for cleanliness and bugs and it was clean. The bathroom was clean. And the room was just all around cozy. I was in love with the fireplace that was in the room and to be honest, I was quite content sitting in front of it rather than enjoying the beauty of whistler. The view from our room was the parking lot, however the backdrop was a beautiful mountain so I was happy with that. We didn\u2019t eat at the hotel but the restaurant looked very nice. It was very cold, but we walked the grounds and I definitely would love to return when it\u2019s warmer. We came to ski and it is an added bonus that they provide lockers for your equipment. It is just up the road and from the lockers you can walk to the lift which really is a nice added bonus. The hotel has some restaurants you can walk to. There even is a supermarket, gas station and Starbucks. It is a short drive to whistler village as well. If I ever go back to whistler, this is where I will stay hands down.

The new lady checking us in had nothing to say except 'I don't know what to do' over and over again.  I guess there is no one to call?  Not much help but we were given a room finally.  The morning lady didn't have a very good attitude and didn't explain anything to us about the hotel either even though I explained to her what happened during our check-in.  She made me feel unwelcome although I told her we were here for our 21st anniversary.  Nothing complimentary to say.  No warm pleasantries.  Next.  As we left to explore, we came back to a dirty room.  No cleaning or refreshing of towels or anything was done in our room even though we wanted it tidied up.  This is a dog friendly hotel and I didn't have a dog with me but I must have gotten a dog room.  I'm allergic to most dogs.  My room made me itchy and I was hoping we could have gotten the room cleaned and more lotion to apply to my itchy skin.  So my husband went downstairs to ask for more big towels and more lotion as we used ours.  Supposedly someone would be bringing them.  We waited hours and nothing happened so we finally fell asleep.  I woke up in the middle of the night itching so I had to take another shower.  As we checked out, the process was also not warm. No questions asked, nothing said except just the bare minimum in order to check one out.  This is one of the worse hotels possible in terms of customer service and we travel a lot and stay at many hotels in the US, Canada and Europe.
